The
<A HREF="http://luastockholm2015.se/">Lua Workshop 2015</A>
will be held
in Stockholm, Sweden,
on October 15&ndash;16, 2015,
courtesy of King.

<P>
As in previous workshops

the main goal of the workshop is to allow the Lua
<A HREF="community.html">community</A>
to get together and meet in person and talk about
the Lua language, its uses, and its implementation.
<P>

The workshop is open to everyone interested in Lua.
There is no registration fee but participants are required to

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Erlang is well-known for its ability to build scalable, massively
concurrent and fault tolerant systems. While it is relatively easy to
interface Erlang with Lua this will generally not give Lua access to all
these features. Luerl is an implementation of Lua in Erlang which runs
natively on the Erlang VM. Lua programs running in Luerl are part of
the Erlang system and therefore have full access to all of the features
of the Erlang system. This talk will give a brief description of the
main properties of the Erlang VM and how Luerl implemented and how it
can interact with the Erlang system. It will also show a simple example
program demonstrating these features.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">LuaJIT compiler offers an efficient mechanism for calling external C
functions and using C data structures inside Lua code, named LuaJIT
FFI library. The FFI library requires C declarations of the functions
and structures that will be used from Lua code. The talk will describe
development of a tool that generates these declarations. It generates
declarations for marked functions and structures in C code, using the
functionalities offered by the Clang compiler.</DIV>

of Lua. I would like to talk about the implementation of Ravi. I hope
to cover how the static typing is implemented, the JIT compilation
approach, the challenges and compromises made to maintain compatibility
with Lua, and finally the array extensions in Ravi, including example
use cases and benefits of the approach.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">The Basel Zoo is currently building a new structure to hold their
african elephants: project tembea.  Visitors to the zoo can support the
project by becoming a mentor when they insert coins into a machine that
has been custom built for this purpose:  Two coin acceptors, one for
children, one for adults (who pay double...) have been mounted on a
steel frame together with a large LED display with 30cm high characters.
The whole machinery has been installed in a large artificial rock which
is, surrounced by elephant models painted in green and gold, a real
eye-catcher and which already attracted more than 10'000 mentors.
A large display shows the current number of mentors, this number is also
visible on the webpage http://www.zoobasel-tembea.ch/de/index.php.
At the heart of this installation is a PostgreSQL database that holds
the counter. The display, the coin acceptors, the webinterface and the
SMS gateway are all separate programs written in the Lua programming
lannguage. They are completely decoupled from each other by using
PostgreSQLs asynchronous notification mechanism.  And update of the
counter value from whatever source, be it one of the coin acceptor
processes, the sms gateway, or even a system administrator using psql,
will cause a notification to be sent and the display and connected
webbrowser to update the counter value (using websockets in the latter
case).
In this presentation, the "elephant mentoring machine" is briefly
explained, as is the overall system architecture.  Then the Lua
PostgreSQL interface, written by the author and available under an open
source license, is presented.  It will be shown how Lua can be used to
write complex and well-performing database applications with minimal
code, but also how Lua and the PostgreSQL interface can be used to
quickly prototype an application which will later be implemented in a
different programming language.
Lua is best known as a very efficient scripting language, it is,
however, little known that it had been designed as a data-handling
language. In conjunction with PostgreSQL and the feature-complete
Lua-PostgreSQL-interface it is a ideal tool for data-centric application
development.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Industrial big-data analysis tools like Hadoop are often unwieldy,
cumbersome to use and expensive to maintain, especially if you're new
to the field. It is well and good if you have a cluster set up and a
handy team of engineers to maintain it. But what if you're a researcher,
alone with a big dataset, a Linux machine (or, better, several) and no
clue how to do Java? In this talk I will share a few handy tricks on how
to quickly process and run preliminary analysis on large datasets with
nothing more than LuaJIT and some shell magic.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Elasticsearch is a distributed and scalable data platform written in
Java that, besides the transport protocol (Java to Java), offers a
very complete REST API accessed through JSON. This talk will cover the
details of the Elasticsearch client we built for Lua as a part of the
GSoC program in the LabLua organization.  By using the elasticsearch-lua
client a programmer can access most Elasticsearch functionalities and
benefit from: proper load balancing across all nodes with pluggable and
multiple selection strategies; a connection pool; and the reindex feature
(not available in Elasticsearch).  We will also show two PoC. One PoC
will show how this client could be used to implement a search feature in
a website that is based on a SQL database, and the other PoC will show
how a lot of data could be collected and indexed into Elasticsearch so
easy and fast analytics can be performed.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Memory bloat is a software problem that happens when the memory
consumption of a program exceeds the programmer's expectations. In many
cases, memory bloat hurts performance or even crashes applications. In
this talk we present two tools created to help Lua programmers identify
memory consumption problems. The first memory profiler we present
is luamemprofiler, which was developed to explore three techniques:
real-time visualization, type/class data categorization, and ongoing
interaction. The second memory profiler we present is lmprof, which was
created to explore gprof's largely used model which summarizes, after
the main program execution, events based on function calls.</DIV>

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Konstantin Osipov</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Tarantool)</SPAN>
<DIV CLASS="abstract">I will focus on a practical use case: task queue application, using
Tarantool as an application server and a database.  The idea of the task
queue is that producers put tasks (objects) into a queue, and consumers
take tasks, perform them, mark as completed.  The queue must guarantee
certain properties: if a consumer failed, a task should return to the
queue automatically, a task can't be taken by more than one consumer,
priorities on tasks should be satisfied.  With Tarantool, a task queue is
a distributed networked application: there are multiple consumer/producer
endpoints (hosts) through which a user can interact with the queue.
The queue itself is a fault-tolerant distributed database: every task
is stored in Tarantool database and replicated in multiple copies.  If a
machine goes down, the state of a task is tracked on a replica, and the
user can continue working with the queue through a replica.  Total power
failure is also not an issue, since tasks are stored persistently on disk
with transactional semantics.  Performance of such an application is in
hundreds of thousands of transactions per second.  At the same time,
the queue is highly customizable, since it's written entirely in Lua,
is a Lua rock, but the code is running inside the database. This is the
strength of Lua: one size doesn't have to fit all, and you don't have
to sacrifice performance if you need customization.  The second part of
the talk will be about implementation details, performance numbers, a
performance comparison with other queue vendors (beanstalkd, rabbitmq)
in particular, and an overview of the implementation from language
bindings point of view: how we make database API available in Lua,
what are the challenges and performance hurdles of such binding.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">The Enlightenment Foundation Libraries is a suite of graphics and other
libraries for writing applications written in C. It's very lighweight
and powerful, but its C API greatly reduces user friendliness; I aim to
solve this problem by introducing a LuaJIT based scripting runtime into
core EFL.  This will allow everyone to write their applications easily in
the Lua language, while having access to EFL APIs that are automatically
generated and thus always up to date thanks to our elaborate language
independent API description system.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">First time I laid hands on a computer, it was a brazilian clone of the ZX
Spectrum, an 8 bit computer from 1982. Many years ago, I wrote an emulator
in C for it. So when Lua 5.3 came out with its fancy bitwise operators,
the logical thing for me to do was to try to port it.  In this talk I'll
discuss the ins and outs of its development, the challenges faced and
the places were Lua simplified the job enormously.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">You just wrote a Lua module and would like to test it with different Lua
versions? No problem.  Is a mix of Lua and C? And you want to make sure
it works with different compilers? Sure.  And you want to test it with
different operating systems? We got you covered.  In this talk I'll
give an overview of some of the available options in the continuous
integration market and the benefits of running your tests automatically.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">* Briefly: my reasons for choosing MOAI
* Concept of game: tiled-based maze adventure + match-3 battles
* Implementing basic parts:
  * Game model: Loop, maps, actors, abilities etc
  * Model controller: player action processing etc
  * GUI: manager, panels, map views, primitives, sprites, configs
* Benefits of engine:
  * high quality of code
  * open source - self-documented, easy extension etc
  * support of tools: tiled, texture packer etc
  * can develop under Linux
* Problems:
  * rather small community
  * lack of documentation (not so important since we have sources)
  * weak GUI frameworks
  * bugs in functionality
  * bugs in build scripts
* Conclusion: Is the game worth the candle?</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">CodeFlow is an IDE that we have designed for interactively developing iOS applications in Lua.  The idea of the talk is to put the focus on a few IDE features that could be of interest for a large part of the Lua community (at least for those who aren't allergic to the concept of IDE :).  These highlights will cover: - a quick tour of what a real syntax-driven Lua source editor can bring, - a brief focus on Lua Environments, a powerful but often misunderstood feature of Lua since 5.2, showing how a builtin Lua Env support in the IDE can help the developer to use them effectively, -  a discussion about how Lua modules are managed, and about the benefits of rewriting Lua 'require' function for matching specific needs, - an overview of the debugger which is an essential part of the system, associated with a stack-context-aware command line interface (i.e. that allows to use and modify local variables and upvalues of the selected Lua stack level) - a demo of interactive Lua-to-C bindings generation and how it is integrated with the rest of the IDE.</DIV>
