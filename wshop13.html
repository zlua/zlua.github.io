The Lua Workshop 2013 will be held
in Toulouse, France,
on November 23&ndash;24, 2013.
It will be part of
<A HREF="http://2013.capitoledulibre.org/">Le Capitole du Libre</A>,
a larger FOSS event.
<P>

As in previous workshops
(<A HREF="wshop05.html">2005</A>,

<A HREF="wshop11.html">2011</A>,
<A HREF="wshop12.html">2012</A>),
the main goal of the workshop is to allow the Lua
<A HREF="community.html">community</A>
to get together and meet in person and talk about
the Lua language, its uses, and its implementation.
<P>

The workshop is open to everyone interested in Lua.
There is no registration fee but participants are required to
<A HREF="#registration">register</A>
because space is limited.
<P>

Please make your own

<P>

We shall have
a plenary talk by
<A HREF="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/">Roberto Ierusalimschy</A>
(Lua's chief architect)
and several contributed talks.
There will also be plenty of time for getting together and chatting about Lua.

<P>
All activities in the workshop will be conducted in English.
Other activities in Captiole du Libre are mainly in French.

<P>
This event will be composed of talks, all Saturday 23rd and Sunday 24th morning.
For the Sunday afternoon, it would be great to have more interactive workshops, since the Sunday is usually more of a general public event.

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Lua, besides its other virtues, is quite easy to learn. Nevertheless, Lua is a programming language, and in order to learn it one must invest a considerable effort to learn to write programs.
It is often the case that, on one hand, there is a need to configure lots and lots of business logic intricate and ever-changing rules, but, on the other hand, the person who has the most expertise on the particular business logic area &ndash; domain expert &ndash; not have any clue on how to write code effectively (or even at all).
All kinds of clumsy UIs, spaghetti code, wasted dedicated scripter's hours and other unpleasantries stem from that problem. Our flagship product &ndash; Business logic editor toolkit &ndash; to alleviate that somewhat by providing a programmer with a set of tools to easily build a business-logic configuration UI, suitable for a non-programmer domain expert, and an easy, platform-agnostic way to seamlessly tie business-logic configuration from that UI to an existing (or newly written) codebase, effectively creating a visual domain-specific programming language.
Our toolkit is written in Lua (and some JavaScript), and it is a seventh generation implementation of the concept behind it. In this talk I'll talk a little about the past generations, describe the mechanics behind the current implementation in some detail, and I'll share our thoughts on how the next generation should look like &ndash; a new approach on the internal DSL design in Lua.
And a promise: no marketing speak in the talk, and as much technical details as I'd dare (and time will permit)!</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Our primary target was integrate a scripting language to delegate specific operation on data to something else than the engine. The specific target, required very intimate integration with a multitude of features Document/Object Oriented belonging to the engine and at the same time a great simplicity and flexibility of development.
By placing the look at the panorama of scripting languages that could lend themselves for this purpose, whereas the integration would take place with modules fully implemented in C/C++, Lua language has soon proved our right choice. It is widespread and is used in many different areas. It has a wide extensibility as well a wide range of functionality and libraries already available, and is designed to suit a multitude of our needs. In its declination LuaJIT, also offers a level of performance further advanced.
Our implementation of Lua in eXtraWay provides an executor of scripts, organized into packages in java style, which can be invoked explicitly (Stored Procedures) or run automatically inside the engine(Triggers) and who are able to take advantage each other through a simple inclusion system.
We have developed specific packages for individual databases eXtraWay in which it was necessary to carry out specific and tricky operations on documents and indices. Were also developed generic library to perform common operations on documents through Lua, reusable in multiple scenarios.
Each package refers to a dynamic library specifically designed allowing you to use the functionality of the server invocandole directly from Lua scripts built.
so you can create records, save them, search them, operate on lists of records and their abstract, load the XML content and perform multiple operations on the same structure including managing digital content associated with them. You can also perform batch external and different solutions have been implemented for the management of large amounts of data in memory and on file.</DIV>

Celedev has developed a live-coding-oriented development environment for iOS apps. This talk will be focused on the role of Lua as a key component of this system. It will present the reasons behind the choice of Lua and will discuss several technical aspects of the integration of Lua in a complex host operating system like iOS, including:
<UL>
<LI> Multi-threading aspects: We will see why multi-threaded Lua is a mandatory feature in our system and we will show how to use the lua_newthread() function to run code from multiple threads within a standard Lua VM. We'll also  provide a few implementation tips &amp; tricks to avoid common traps in Lua multi-threaded implementation.
<LI> Object-Oriented framework: The need for integration of Lua code with the iOS Objective C runtime has led us to design an extensive Lua Objects Framework, fully compatible with the Objective C model, but with a very Lua-ish spirit; we will give a brief overview of this framework.
<LI> Dynamic code update: we will discuss Celedev dynamic code update feature from the Lua implementation perspective and show how it is integrated with the Lua require() function.
<LI> Lua Debugger: And, as a good debugger is key for serious software development, we will put the highlight on some original features of the Celedev debugger and show the debugger integration with other features of the system discussed previously.
</UL>
This talk will be illustrated by short coding &amp; debugging demos of the Celedev Responsive Programming system on iOS devices.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Justin Cormack</SPAN>
<DIV CLASS="abstract">Recently I have been working on a project (called "ljsyscall") to
experiment with scripting operating systems in Lua. In this talk I
will look at progress so far, what I have learned, and look at a
roadmap towards an operating system that is scriptable entirely in
Lua.
Initially ljsyscall was an experiment to see what a scripting
interface for Linux would look like in Lua. I started with system
calls, and progress was slow, as there are lots of them and you cannot
do very much with just a few. But I carried on, and then started
adding facilities built on the raw system calls, such as configuration
of network interfaces, security systems etc. The aim was to get to the
point where an application could easily configure its whole runtime
environment without needing a large infrastructure of shell scripts
etc. It was partly driven by the way that the way systems boot was
being made less transparent by code such as systemd which moves code
into C not shell, making it harder to understand how an operating
system works, while one that works in Lua should be easier to
understand.
The second phase, in 2013, involved more experiments, this time with
NetBSD, and the NetBSD rump kernel, which allows parts of NetBSD, such
as file systems and the network stack, to run in userspace, even in
other operating systems, or in systems with no operating system at all
such as embedded systems. Lua scripting was extended to be able to
script these, with the same interface as on the operating system
itself. This allowed things like booting Lua natively as a guest under
Xen, without an operating system at all but with a full network stack
and file system, in a couple of megabytes.
Future work includes further work with NetBSD, as Lua is now a
component in the core set of packages in the operating system,
although it is not yet used there. NetBSD is a good complement to Lua,
as it is small, portable and powerful. I intend to work towards
producing a scripting interface for all the core functionality, in
what will be a fruitful partnership. Other work in progress is the
port of ljsyscall from LuaJIT that it originally targetted to PUC Lua,
and further extensions for Linux.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">One of the primary issues with Lua in the wild is the lack of
standardized batteries included distribution. Creating and maintaining a
distribution that is as portable and flexible as Lua is challenging,
especially for modules that depend on external libraries. Solutions to
this problem are partially available in form of the LuaRocks and LuaDist
projects, however there are still some standing issues that have to be
addressed. This talk will summarize the challenges of building
multi-platform Lua distributions and provide some insight into the
planned unification between the two most prominent package management
systems in the Lua ecosystem.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">arcapos is a commercial point of sale solution for retail and ticketing
with a focus on ease of use, speed, and stability.  The frontend can be
extended using the Lua language, the backoffice parts are written to 90%
in Lua.
With integrating Lua we had two things in mind:  Allow us to quickly
react to customer requests, and, allow experienced users and resellers
to change the system.
This is a (technical) talk about how we integrated Lua into the arcapos
point of sale solution.  This is not a marketing talk, of course, but
rather technical issues we faced, how we solved them, code examples
(both C and Lua) etc.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">The Web is the biggest platform in the world and it can now be scripted in
Lua. Anything that has been created in JavaScript can be created using Lua
too, with the help of a lightweight virtual machine called Moonshine.
In this talk I'll introduce Moonshine and walk you through how to get
started with Lua in the browser. We'll write some code, create some APIs,
explore the debugger and discover a few things that are now possible with
Lua and the Web.</DIV>

this model implemented in event processing frameworks like Node.js,
EventMachine or Twisted. In fact, LuaNode is heavily based on Node.js.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Debian is a free OS distribution on which more than 120 derivatives
are based.  It distributes around 20K different softwares, precompiled
and packaged for an average of 10 architectures.  Lua is part of it,
and the 5.1 runtime counts more than 100K installations (in Debian,
10 times more in Ubuntu, ...).
In this talk I describe how Lua fits in this picture, and how the
peculiarities of Lua make it easy or hard to package it and its
libraries for a mainstream software distribution like Debian.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">Lua is part of the <A HREF="http://www.netbsd.org/">NetBSD operating system</A>.
It is not only used to script programs in userspace, but also to run Lua
code in kernel space.  What sounds bold at first sight allows for
interesting experiments, e.g. rapid system code development, ideal for
prototypes, proof of concepts and such.
In this talk, I'll give an overview of the current state of Lua
in NetBSD, the components and NetBSD specific bindings, and what
generally can be done using the NetBSD and Lua combination.</DIV>
