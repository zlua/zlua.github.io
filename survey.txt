   * How did you find out about Lua? Do you think Lua should be more
     widely known? How could this be done effectively?




   * If you use Lua in your projects, what kind of role does it have?
     Which languages, if any, were replaced in your projects by Lua?




   * How large is the role of Lua in your projects? Can you estimate
     how many lines of Lua code it has and what percentage of the total
     code is written in Lua?




   * What version of Lua do you use? If you have switched to the latest
     version, why have you done so? If you still use an earlier version,
     why haven't you moved to the latest version?




   * If you don't (yet) use Lua in your projects, do you see yourself
     using Lua instead of another language in the near future? If so,
     which languages do you think will be replaced?




   * Do you use Lua at work? If so, how many people use Lua in your
     organization? If not, do you think you'll use Lua at work in the
     near future? If not, why?




   * What features or libraries do you miss most and wish that Lua had?
     Does the lack of these features or libraries preclude you from
     using Lua?




   * If you wish, add any other comments or identify yourself.
