<H2><A NAME="what">What is Lua?</A></H2>

<P>
Lua is a powerful, fast, lightweight, embeddable scripting language.

<P>
Lua combines simple procedural syntax with
powerful data description constructs based on
associative arrays and extensible semantics.

Lua
is dynamically typed,
runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine,
and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection,
making it ideal for
configuration,
scripting,
and
rapid prototyping.

<H2><A NAME="origin">Where does Lua come from?</A></H2>
<P>
Lua is designed, implemented, and maintained by
a
<A HREF="authors.html">team</A>
at
<A HREF="http://www.puc-rio.br/">PUC-Rio</A>,
the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.
Lua was born and raised in
<A HREF="http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/">Tecgraf</A>,
formerly the Computer Graphics Technology Group of PUC-Rio.
Lua is now housed at
<A HREF="http://www.lua.inf.puc-rio.br/">LabLua</A>,
a laboratory of the
<A HREF="http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/">Department of Computer Science</A>
of PUC-Rio.

<H2><A NAME="name">What's in a name?</A></H2>
<P>
"Lua"
(pronounced <B>LOO-ah</B>)
means "Moon" in Portuguese.
As such, it is neither an acronym nor an abbreviation, but a noun.
More specifically,
"Lua" is a name,
the name of the Earth's moon and the name of the language.
Like most names,
it should be written in lower case with an initial capital, that is, "Lua".
Please do not write it as "LUA",
which is both ugly and confusing,
because then it becomes an acronym
with
<A HREF="http://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/lua">different meanings</A>
for different people.
So, please, write "Lua" right!

<H2><A NAME="join">Joining the community</A></H2>
<P>
There are several
<A HREF="community.html#meeting">meeting places</A>
for the Lua
<A HREF="community.html">community</A>

in other ways.
One of the focal points is the
<A HREF="lua-l.html">mailing list</A>,
which is very
<A HREF="lua-l-stats.html">active</A>

<P>
You can
meet part of the Lua community in person by attending
a
<A HREF="community.html#workshop">Lua Workshop</A>.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="why">Why choose Lua?</A></H2>

<H3>Lua is a proven, robust language</H3>
<P>
Lua has been used in
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scriptable_software">many industrial applications</A>
(e.g.,
<A HREF="http://since1968.com/article/190/mark-hamburg-interview-adobe-photoshop-lightroom-part-2-of-2">Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom</A>),
with an emphasis on embedded systems
(e.g.,
the
<A HREF="http://www.ginga.org.br/">Ginga</A>
middleware for digital TV in Brazil)
and
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scripted_video_games">games</A>
(e.g.,
<A HREF="http://www.wowwiki.com/Lua">World of Warcraft</A> and Angry Birds).
Lua is currently
<A HREF="http://www.satori.org/2009/03/the-engine-survey-general-results/">the leading scripting language in games</A>.
Lua has a solid
<A HREF="manual/5.3/">reference manual</A>
and there are
<A HREF="docs.html#books">several books about it</A>.
Several
<A HREF="versions.html">versions</A>
of Lua have been released and used in
<A HREF="https://sites.google.com/site/marbux/home/where-lua-is-used">real applications</A>
since its creation in 1993.
Lua featured in
<A HREF="http://research.ihost.com/hopl/HOPL-III.html">HOPL&nbsp;III,
the Third ACM SIGPLAN History of Programming Languages Conference</A>,
in June 2007.
Lua won the
<A HREF="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/129084/Announcing_Game_Developer_magazines_2011_Front_Line_Award_winners.php">Front Line Award 2011</A>
from the
<A HREF="http://www.gdmag.com/">Game Developers Magazine</A>.

<H3>Lua is fast</H3>
<P>
Lua has a deserved reputation for performance.
To claim to be "as fast as Lua" is an aspiration of other scripting languages.
Several benchmarks show Lua as the fastest language
in the realm of interpreted scripting languages.
Lua is fast not only in fine-tuned benchmark programs,
but in real life too.
Substantial fractions of large applications have been written in Lua.

<P>
If you need even more speed, try
<A HREF="http://luajit.org/">LuaJIT</A>,
an independent implementation of Lua using a just-in-time compiler.

<H3>Lua is portable</H3>
<P>
Lua is <A HREF="download.html">distributed</A> in a small package and
builds out-of-the-box
in all platforms that have a standard C compiler.
Lua runs on all flavors of Unix and Windows,
on mobile devices
(running Android, iOS, BREW, Symbian, Windows Phone),
on embedded microprocessors (such as ARM and Rabbit,
for applications like Lego MindStorms),
on IBM mainframes, etc.

<P>
For specific reasons why Lua is a good choice also for constrained devices,
read
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2007-11/msg00248.html">this summary</A>
by Mike Pall.
See also a
<A HREF="http://www.schulze-mueller.de/download/lua-poster-090207.pdf">poster</A>
created by Timm Müller.

<H3>Lua is embeddable</H3>
<P>
Lua is a fast language engine with small footprint that
you can embed easily into your application.
Lua has a simple and well documented API
that allows strong integration with code written in other languages.
It is easy to extend Lua with libraries written in other languages.
It is also easy to extend programs written in other languages with Lua.
Lua has been used to extend programs written not only in C and C++,
but also in Java, C#, Smalltalk, Fortran, Ada, Erlang,
and even in other scripting languages,
such as Perl and Ruby.

<H3>Lua is powerful (but simple)</H3>
<P>
A fundamental concept in the design of Lua is to
provide <EM>meta-mechanisms</EM> for implementing features,
instead of providing a host of features directly in the language.
For example,
although Lua is not a pure object-oriented language,
it does provide meta-mechanisms for implementing classes and inheritance.
Lua's meta-mechanisms bring an economy of concepts and keep the language small,
while allowing the semantics to be extended in unconventional ways.

<H3>Lua is small</H3>
<P>
Adding Lua to an application does not bloat it.
The
<A HREF="ftp/lua-5.3.2.tar.gz">tarball for Lua 5.3.2</A>,
which contains source code and documentation,
takes 282K compressed and 1.1M uncompressed.
The source contains around 24000 lines of C.
Under 64-bit Linux,
the Lua interpreter built with all standard Lua libraries takes 245K
and the Lua library takes 419K.

<H3>Lua is free</H3>
<P>
Lua is free open-source software,
distributed under a
<A HREF="license.html">very liberal license</A>
(the well-known MIT license).
It may be used for any purpose, including commercial purposes,
at absolutely no cost.
Just
<A HREF="download.html">download</A>
it and use it.
