Lua is a powerful and fast programming language
that is easy to learn and use and to embed into your application.

<P>
Lua is designed to be a lightweight embeddable scripting language
and is used for
<A HREF="uses.html">all sorts of applications</A>
from games to web applications and image processing.

<P>
See the
<A HREF="about.html">about</A> page
for details
and some reasons why you should choose Lua.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="installing">Installing</A></H2>
<P>
Use the
<A HREF="demo.html">live demo</A>
to play with Lua
if you don't want to install anything on your computer.

<P>
To run Lua programs on your computer,
you'll need a standalone Lua interpreter
and perhaps some additional Lua libraries.
Use your favorite text editor to write your Lua programs.
Make sure to save your programs as plain text.

<P>
If you use Windows,
try
<A HREF="http://luadist.org/">LuaDist</A>,
a multi-platform distribution of the Lua that includes batteries.

<P>
If you use Linux or Mac OS X,
Lua is either already installed on your system or there is a Lua package for it.
Make sure you get the latest release of Lua
(currently 5.3.2).

<P>
Lua is also quite easy to build from source,
as explained below.

<H3>Building from source</H3>

<P>
Lua is very easy to build and install.
Just <A HREF="download.html">download</A> it and
follow the
<A HREF="manual/5.3/readme.html">instructions</A>
in the package.

<P>
Here is a simple terminal session that
downloads the current release of Lua and builds it in a Linux system:
<PRE CLASS="session">
curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.2.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.3.2.tar.gz
cd lua-5.3.2
make linux test
</PRE>
For Mac OS X, use <CODE>make macosx test</CODE>.

<P>
If you use Windows and want to build Lua from source,
there are
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/wiki/BuildingLuaInWindowsForNewbies">detailed instructions</A>
in the
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/wiki/">wiki</A>.

<H3>Embedding</H3>

<P>
To embed Lua into your program,
you'll need Lua headers to compile your program and
a Lua library to link with it.
You'll also need a C or C++ compiler for your program,
because the Lua headers and library are written in C.
If you're getting a ready-made Lua package for your platform,
you'll probably need the development package as well.
Otherwise, just
<A HREF="download.html">download</A> Lua and
add its source directory to your project.
