<H2><A NAME="1">1 &ndash; Distribution</A></H2>
<P>
See the
<A HREF="download.html">download</A>
and
<A HREF="start.html">get started</A>
pages
for instructions on how to get source code and binaries for Lua.

<H3><A NAME="1.1">1.1 &ndash; What do I need to build Lua?</A></H3>
<P>
Lua is implemented in pure ANSI C
and compiles unmodified in all known platforms.
All you need to build Lua is an ANSI C compiler
(<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/gcc.html">gcc</A> is a popular one).
Lua also compiles cleanly as C++.

<P>
If you are building Lua in a Unix system (like Linux or Mac OS X),
then you probably already have everything you need and
simply typing <TT>make</TT> should do it.
(You'll only have to choose a suitable platform.)
Otherwise,
see the
<A HREF="#1.2">next question</A>.
In any case,
for full instructions
see the <A HREF="manual/5.3/readme.html">readme</A>
that comes with the distribution.

<A HREF="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/71/04700691/0470069171.pdf">Chapter 1</A>
of the book
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470069171/lua-docs-20">Beginning Lua Programming</A>
contains detailed instructions for downloading, building, and installing Lua.
Here are simple instructions for Linux and Mac OS X:

<P>
If you don't have the time or the inclination to compile Lua yourself,
get a binary from
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/wiki/LuaBinaries">LuaBinaries</A>.
If you only want to try Lua,
try the
<A HREF="demo.html">live demo</A>.
Try also
<A HREF="http://luadist.org/">LuaDist</A>,
a multi-platform distribution of Lua that includes batteries.

<H3><A NAME="1.2">1.2 &ndash; How do I build Lua in Windows and other systems?</A></H3>
<P>
This depends on your compiler.
Most compilers in these platforms require that you create "project" files.
You'll need to create projects (or whatever your compiler uses)
for building the library, the interpreter, and the compiler.
The sources are all in the <TT>src</TT> directory.
The exact lists of which modules should go into which project are given in
the <A HREF="manual/5.3/readme.html#other">readme</A>.

<H3><A NAME="1.3">1.3 &ndash; When is the next version due?</A></H3>
<P>
Lua is in continuous development but new versions are
<A HREF="versions.html">infrequent</A>.

<P>
<A HREF="versions.html#5.3">Lua 5.3</A> was released on 12 Jan 2015.

<H3><A NAME="1.4">1.4 &ndash; What changes will the next version bring?</A></H3>
<P>
<A HREF="versions.html#5.3">Lua 5.3</A> has just been released.
For a preview of what is coming in the next version,
try a
<A HREF="work/">work version</A>
when available.

<P>
If you're concerned with incompatibilities,
you shouldn't,
because we make every effort to avoid introducing any incompatibilities.
When incompatibilities are unavoidable,
previous code is usually supported unmodified,
possibly by building Lua with a suitable compilation flag.
In any case,
the
<A HREF="manual/5.3/">reference manual</A>
contains a
<A HREF="manual/5.3/manual.html#8">list of incompatibilities</A>.

<H3><A NAME="1.5">1.5 &ndash; Is Lua free software?</A></H3>
<P>
Yes,
Lua is freely available for any purpose, including commercial purposes,
at absolutely no cost,
and using it requires no paperwork.
Read the details in the
<A HREF="license.html">license page</A>.

<H3><A NAME="1.6">1.6 &ndash; Is Lua compatible with GPL software?</A></H3>
<P>
Yes.
Lua is distributed under the terms of the very liberal and well-known
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.html">MIT license</A>,
which is
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">compatible with GPL</A>
and is approved by the
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</A>.
Read the details in the
<A HREF="license.html">license page</A>.

<H3><A NAME="1.7">1.7 &ndash; What do I call software derived from Lua?</A></H3>
<P>
Lua is intended to be used in other people's software,
including yours.
In most cases,
Lua is simply extended with new functions that
adapt Lua to your specific domain.
This is exactly what Lua was designed for.
When the time comes to distribute your software two questions may arise:
"May I still call the language inside my software Lua?"
and
"May I call it something else?".

<P>
The answer is the following:
If the syntax and the semantics of the language
(that is, the parser and the virtual machine)
remain the same,
then the language is still Lua.
If you simply add new libraries,
or even replace the standard Lua libraries with your own libraries,
the language is still the same, and
you don't need to (and probably shouldn't) give it a completely different name.

<P>
If you have changed the syntax or the semantics of the language,
then it's probably a minor extension and
you'll probably benefit from calling your language a Lua variant,
so that you can refer users to existing Lua documentation and community,
with the caveats relating to your extension of the language.

<P>
Usually,
people use some name that has Lua as part of it
(CGILua, LuaMan, LuaOrb, etc.),
so that
it is clear that it <EM>uses</EM> Lua
but
it is not the official Lua distribution.
In other words, it should be very clear that your software uses Lua
(or, more specifically, that the language inside your software <I>is</I> Lua),
but also it should be clear that your software <EM>is not</EM> Lua.

<P>
In any case,
please give us credit for Lua,
according to the
<A HREF="license.html">license</A>.

<P>
If this explanation is still unclear,
please
<A HREF="contact.html">contact us</A>.

<H3><A NAME="1.8">1.8 &ndash; Is there a public revision control repository?</A></H3>
<P>
No, there is no publicly available repository of Lua development code.
Lua is open-source software but it is not openly developed.
Read
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2008-06/msg00407.html">this explanation</A>.
If you want to see a preview of what is coming in the next version,
you'll have to wait until a
<A HREF="work/">work version</A>
becomes available.
<!--
try a
<A HREF="work/">work version</A>.
-->

<H3><A NAME="1.9">1.9 &ndash; Do you accept patches?</A></H3>
<P>
We encourage discussions based on
tested code solutions for problems and enhancements,
but we never incorporate third-party code verbatim.
We always try to understand the issue and the proposed solution
and then,
if we choose to address the issue,
we provide our own code.
All code in Lua is written by us.

<A HREF="#1.8">previous question</A>.

<H2><A NAME="2">2 &ndash; Information</A></H2>
<P>
Complete information on Lua can be found in its
<A HREF="home.html">home page</A>.
You may want to read a
<A HREF="about.html">summary</A> first,
choose an entry point from the
<A HREF="map.html">site map</A>,
or learn how to
<A HREF="start.html">get started</A> with Lua.

<H3><A NAME="2.1">2.1 &ndash; Is there a mailing list for Lua?</A></H3>
<P>
Yes, a friendly and <A HREF="lua-l-stats.html">active</A> one called
<A HREF="lua-l.html">lua-l</A>.
Everyone is welcome.
Read all about it
<A HREF="lua-l.html">here</A>.

<P>
For discussions in Portuguese,
there is
<A HREF="lua-br.html">Lua BR</A>,
the Brazilian version of lua-l.

<H3><A NAME="2.2">2.2 &ndash; Is there a newsgroup for Lua?</A></H3>
<P>
No,
just use the
<A HREF="lua-l.html">mailing list</A>.
If you want to read the postings using a web interface,
see the archives at
<A HREF="http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.lua.general">Gmane</A>
and
<A HREF="http://marc.info/?l=lua-l">MARC</A>.
You may want also want to
<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/">search the archives</A>.

<P>
If you're looking for a Q&amp;A forum for Lua,
try
<A HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lua">stackoverflow</A>
or
<A HREF="http://pt.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/lua">pt.stackoverflow</A>.

<H3><A NAME="2.3">2.3 &ndash; How do I report a bug in Lua?</A></H3>
<P>
First, try to make sure that you have indeed found a bug.
<A HREF="bugs.html">Check</A>
whether the problem has been already
<A HREF="bugs.html">reported</A>
(and probably fixed).

<A HREF="http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/">Search the archives</A>
of the
<A HREF="lua-l.html">mailing list</A>
to see whether
someone else has come across the same problem
and have a fix or an explanation.

After that research,
if you still think you may have found a bug,
post a report in the
<A HREF="lua-l.html">mailing list</A>.

<P>
Before reporting a bug,
try to identify a "minimal" program that exhibits the bug,
also known as
<A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example">MWE</A>
and
<A HREF="http://sscce.org/">SSCCE</A>.
This makes it much easier to reproduce, document, and track down the bug.
Also,
read Simon Tatham's essay on
<A HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report Bugs Effectively</A>.

<H3><A NAME="2.4">2.4 &ndash; Who uses Lua?</A></H3>
