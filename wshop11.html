<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Ashwin Hirschi</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Reflexis)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">
In this presentation we will discuss how Lua has helped the team at Reflexis develop and evolve <A HREF="http://www.reflexis.nl/flow.html">Reflexis Flow</A>, a model-driven platform for web application development.

Since making software usually requires writing (and wrangling) lots of code, this talk will start by explaining how model-driven development tackles things differently. And as there are paradigms aplenty, it will present our particular take on it and why we feel Reflexis Flow provides people with an environment that makes it easy to create solutions for the web that are both flexible and secure.

Next we'll show how Lua has enabled the team at Reflexis to take somewhat of a middle ground between a procedural, component-based world view and a more high-level, model-driven mindset, resulting in a web application platform that's straight-forward to use but also easy to extend. While Flow developers don't need to be familiar with scripting, it is fair to say that knowing Lua greatly enhances what they can get out of our platform.

Last but not least, this talk will highlight several cases where Lua has really helped our team come up with practical solutions to specific problems. Time permitting we'll also demo some of our tools or a few of the projects completed using Reflexis Flow.

<SPAN CLASS="title">d'Arc</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Henning Diedrich</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Eonblast)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract"><A HREF="http://hdiedrich.github.com/darc/README.html">d'Arc</A> offers an alternate and faster way to write C against both Lua and 
LuaJIT. It is faster, can be easier to write and uses less memory in 
many cases, than the the official API.
d'Arc can be used to make libraries for both Lua and LuaJIT faster, and 
can make it less of a hassle to write patches that target both Lua and 
LuaJIT. d'Arc allows you to use direct (cost-less) C pointers to 
variable contents -- inside the universal Lua variable value holder C 
structure -- in a clear and unified way.
After a brief historical intro, the talk will *primarily* take a closer 
look at the Lua and LuaJIT VMs. I will inspect how iteration works with 
the official Lua API and what happens 'under the hood', in both Lua and 
LuaJIT. I will look at the similarities and the differences in the 
implementation of the essential variable holder, TValue, in Lua and 
LuaJIT. Continue with a look at where LuaJIT tweaks things right there 
and how d'Arc allows you to write single source patches despite the 
differences.
Finally, an easy example will be ported, from using the official API, 
to using d'Arc. We'll compare how it simplifies the source, and make live 
benchmarks to measure the difference, and look at pitfalls.</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="title">Mitigating the danger of malicious bytecode</SPAN>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop11/Cawley.pdf">slides</A><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Peter Cawley</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(University of Oxford)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">In Lua 5.1 and 5.2, the family of load functions permit the loading
of precompiled bytecode in addition to plain source code. We shall
look at some relevant details of the bytecode, and see how these
details can be maliciously abused to escape from a Lua sandbox (in
both 5.1 and 5.2). With the dangers presented, we shall then move to
look at two ways of mitigating them. Firstly, one can wrap the load
functions as to reject bytecode before it is loaded. Secondly, and
more interestingly, one can attempt to algorithmically decide whether
a given piece of bytecode is malicious or not. We shall look at two
such algorithms for validating bytecode: <A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/lbcv/">LBCV</A>, which tries to
reject as little as possible, and my current experimental verifier,
which tries to accept as little as possible.</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="title">LuaDura for Olivetti</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Patrick Rapin</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Olivetti Engineering SA)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">Olivetti is active in the ink-jet printing industry. Our current
prototyping and testing platform is called LuaDura, based on Lua.
The talk will first expose its origins (including its strange name),
and the underlying concepts.
For better comprehension, a rapid look into the foundations of
Olivetti printers firmware will be necessary.
Then we will see some implementation decisions, and some special
features like the "threads" built upon coroutines and native threads
together.
The last part of the talk will be about how the application is used at
Olivetti by lots of various people.
But also what are the mostly experimented problems.
If there is time,
the presentation will finish with a small demo of "midi.lua".</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="title">IceLuva: a Lua-based framework for Magnetic Resonance Image reconstruction</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Francesco Santini</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(University of Basel Hospital - Radiological Physics)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">The reconstruction of images acquired with Magnetic Resonance involves 
many different manipulation steps, dealing with real and complex data. 
In this work, a brief overview of how a clinical MR scanner deals with 
data acquisition and image reconstruction will be given, introducing the 
tools that are generally available to the researcher for the 
customization of this process. Subsequently, the IceLuva framework is 
introduced.
This framework is designed for postprocessing of the (complex) images, a 
step that is usually performed on a separate computer with tools like 
matlab. IceLuva is implemented as a functor in the reconstruction 
pipeline of the scanner, including a Lua virtual machine and the 
appropriate bindings for retrieval and storage of images. Details of the 
integration will be given in the talk.
Finally, some custom extensions to the original Lua language, for basic 
image and complex data manipulation, are implemented in order to 
simplify common operations.
In the end, real-life examples of usage will be given and a performance 
comparison between Lua interpreter, LuaJIT and offline Matlab processing 
will be presented.</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="title">Lua/APR: An extended standard library for Lua</SPAN>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop11/Lua-APR.pdf">slides</A><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Peter Odding</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Netherlands)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">Lua is a very elegant programming language, both because of its
conceptual simplicity and the small size of its implementation, but this
small size comes with a price: Lua's operating system interfaces are
quite minimal and (in a sense) this makes Lua a second-class citizen on
popular platforms like Windows and UNIX systems.
In this presentation the author will talk about Lua/APR, a binding of
the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) for Lua. The talk will start with the
author's motivation for creating the binding, followed by a short
introduction to APR and its origins. Next a short summary of the
available operating system interfaces will be given. After this the
technical challenges in creating the binding will be discussed. Finally
the author will share his master plan in creating Lua/APR :-)</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Fabien Fleutot</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Sierra Wireless)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">Lua's flexibility makes it very versatile, but also makes it harder to
provide good IDE support for it.
Koneki is an Eclipse technology project aiming at proposing advanced tooling
to help M2M (machine-to-machine) developers to create their solution.
The proposed talk aims at highlighting the noteworthy features of Lua
tooling in Koneki, in particular the support for LuaRocks and LuaDoc ; as
well as giving the attendees an overview of a couple of design decisions
which are allowing us to propose extensible tooling, in particular because
most of the actual parsing code is written in (Meta)Lua.</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Fabien Fleutot</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Sierra Wireless)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">We develop a software agent, running on various embedded devices, which
allows to  monitor and control them through the net. A large part of the
embedded code is written in Lua, which offers interesting solutions to many
of our  problems. Among noteworthy technologies we consider presenting, we
have:
coroutine-based scheduling, which allows most of our code to run
unmodified on Linux-based systems as well as OS-less, callback driven
architectures;
a widespread use of ltn12 to handle data streams (IPC as well as
client/server communications, mostly based on Hessian);
some modifications in the Lua bytecode format which allows to keep large
parts of Lua code in flash, thus saving significant amounts of RAM;
an application-generation wizard, which offers flexibility for unforeseen
needs (by allowing to add arbitrary Lua code), and allows to provision
generated applications on architectures which would normally only accept a
single monolithic executable.</SPAN>

<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop11/luaws11_ag.pdf">slides</A><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Alexander Gladysh</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(LogicEditor.com)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">This talk will cover an approach to implementation of internal
declarative DSLs in Lua, developed by the author along with the team.
The approach employs a format-agnostic loader for a declarative DSLs
and several DSL data-handling idioms, all described in the talk.
Described approach is used widely in author's and team's work, and
proven to be game-changing to our Lua application development process.
It significantly eased and streamlined our work with DSLs, leading to
the boom of effective DSL-driven solutions (also briefly showcased in
the talk).</SPAN>

<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Erik Hougaard</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(E Foqus Danmark A/S)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">For the last 11 years, a competitor in the Danish robotic race "DTU 
RoboCup" has been a Lua driven robot called 'Crazy Ivan'. Crazy Ivan is 
one of the most successful robots in the competition. The Crazy Ivan 
robot is designed to drive through a predefined race track and solve 
different tasks such as climbing stairs, passing a guillotine, playing 
golf and much more. Lua is used as the programming language for the 
robot's "brain" and all decisions are taken in Lua. This is the fourth 
incarnation of the robot, now vision based. During the presentation, 
Crazy Ivan will be running live on the floor while its "Master" 
will try to control the action. Anything can&mdash;and will&mdash;happen!</SPAN>

<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop11/Couwenberg.pdf">slides</A><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="speaker">Wim Couwenberg</SPAN>
<SPAN CLASS="affiliation">(Océ)</SPAN><BR>
<SPAN CLASS="abstract">I will present an example of how Lua is used as a support tool in
our build and automatic testing framework. Our software consists of
many components that communicate via interfaces that are defined in a
(proprietary) idl. Interface traces for each component are saved during
each run of our software. These trace files are handled by Lua scripts
to decode them into a readable format and to perform specialized post
mortem analysis on them. Recently I added the possibilty to specify
interface behaviour directly into the idl as small Lua snippets. This
invites developers to properly document their interfaces and at the
same time relieves them of the burden to write analysis scripts per
component.</SPAN>
