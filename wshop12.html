<DIV CLASS="abstract">Textadept is a fast, minimalist, and ridiculously extensible
cross-platform text editor for programmers. It is written in a
combination of C and Lua.
Textadept uses Lua to solve many interesting and complex problems
encountered in text editor design, including syntax highlighting,
syntax-based code completion, and scripting external C libraries and
GUI components. This talk will focus on examining the internals of
Textadept, from its innovative LPeg syntax highlighting engine to the
embedded Lua scripting environment that provides nearly all of the
editor's features. Come learn about Textadept and also about how you
can use and extend it to fit your workflow.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">For the last 11 years, a competitor in the Danish robotic race "DTU
RoboCup" has been a Lua driven robot called 'Crazy Ivan'. Crazy Ivan is
one of the most successful robots in the competition. The Crazy Ivan
robot is designed to drive through a predefined race track and solve
different tasks such as climbing stairs, passing a guillotine, playing
golf and much more. Lua is used as the programming language for the
robot's "brain" and all decisions are taken in Lua. This is the fourth
incarnation of the robot, now vision based. During the presentation,
Crazy Ivan will be running live on the floor while its "Master" will try
to control the action. Anything can? and will? happen!</DIV>

Erlang, comparing embedding Lua in Erlang, using either Erlualib, or 
respectively Luerl, the new Lua VM programmed in Erlang by one of the 
creators of Erlang, Robert Virding. --- Using Lua as a logic scripting 
language within an Erlang server allows to leverage the power of 
Erlang's OTP for the server infrastructure while offering Lua's much 
more accessible syntax and agility for an easy to read implementation of 
business logic. The two languages can be married in different ways and 
the talk is to demonstrate the speed of Erlualib versus the flexibility 
and safety of Luerl. Henning is maintainer of Erlualib and contributor

<DIV CLASS="abstract">OpenFlow is based on an Ethernet switch, with an internal flow-table,
and a standardized interface to add and remove flow entries. It's
becoming incredibly popular and major players in the networking industry
are adopting OpenFlow as a primary part of their strategy. HP, for
instance, has announced this year that they have added OpenFlow support
throughout their ProCurve switches family. Google also announced that
they're using Openflow in their internal infrastructure. OpenFlow is
a great concept, but its original design imposes excessive overheads.
It can simplify network and traffic management in enterprise and data
center environments, because it enables flow-level control over Ethernet
switching and provides global visibility of the flows in the network.
However, such fine-grained control and visibility comes with costs, when
you lead with centered management. LuaFlow brings near-optimal traffic
management, by effectively managing the performance of the network and
minimizing the current load in the server. It also provides a consistent
API for extension and flexibility for integrating with third-party
tools. We give three examples where the controller is needed to manage
traffic: network services load balancing and ID-based QoS using 802.1x
authentication.</DIV>

queues and synchronous calls. Software is running on NET+OS by Digi,
which bundles Thread-X RTOS and TRECK IP stack. Unique aspect is that
VMs are directly controllable from CLI interface, which makes software
development faster and forces component decoupling. By using Lua we
squeezed entire home automation integration server inside ConnectME 9210
module with 8MB RAM and 4MB FLASH, which is slightly larger than RJ45
socket. We implemented auto GC speed tuning, solved memory fragmentation

<DIV CLASS="abstract">The longest common subsequnce (LCS) problem is a dual problem of
the shortest edit distance (SED) problem. The solution to these
problems are used in open source file comparison tools such as WinMerge
and DiffMerge. In 1974, Hirshberg published a reasonably space and
time efficient solution to these problems. This talk will cover the
incremental development and implementation of Hirshberg's algorithm in
Lua, including trade-offs and design decisions along the way. The final
algorithm implementation can be used for customized comparsion of files,
or other applications, as needed.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">The multi-platform open source SciTE editor provides support for
interactive editor-based scripting using Lua and provides a standard
but limited pull-down menu system into which some selected actions can
be added. In order to mimic actions of the original Borland Sprint
editor menu system, a general purpose multi-platform and extensible
character-based menu system was added to SciTE using Lua scripting
of the call tip feature of SciTE. Problems encountered and resolved
during the process included QUERTY/Dvorak keyboard layout issues,
context-sensitive help auto-location in the Lua source, and integrating
support for the Lua-supported Logitech G-13 gaming keypad. Related
issues involved custom lexing support via the Lua-based lexer.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">We will talk about how we made a high performance, multi-tenant,
sandboxed, real time decision engine using Lua. Applications often have
conflicting objectives which are difficult to meet. For example, we
cannot allow one errant thread to affect any other thread, but we cannot
have expensive resource monitoring of threads for CPU or memory usage.
Yet we are able to do both with near zero cost. We will also describe
what that high performance application is and how it works.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">In the spirit of Lua being embeddable, small, and powerful, we present our
efforts to tightly integrate Lua into two well-known and seemingly diverse
programs: the Vi Improved (Vim) text editor, as a language interface (if_lua),
and the PostgreSQL database, as a server-side procedural language (PL/Lua). We
discuss how both projects manage to have a small footprint and a seamless
interface while being effectively feature-complete. The talk will focus on
interface design and implementation details, including strategies for
efficient type conversion, sandboxing, and module integration. We illustrate
both interfaces with many practical examples and conclude with directions for
future work.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">We would like to follow up our presentations of last year Lua Workshop with an update on the project  and an actual demo of building a simple M2M application.
The demo will be articulated around three key components of our solution:
<UL>
<LI> a complete tool suite supporting advanced Lua developments, currently released as an open source project: Koneki.
<LI> an embedded agent, mostly written in Lua, providing M2M oriented APIs that makes application development super easy. This will be released in the forthcoming open source Mihini project.
<LI> our service platform that provides a clean front end to administrate your fleet.
</UL>
We will show a complete live example based on a Raspberry Pi device connected to various actuators and sensors, running the embedded agent, administrated by the AirVantage services platform.</DIV>

<DIV CLASS="abstract">This talk will focus how we used Lua as the language to build a
domain specific IDE to address the integration market. Middleware
covers a specific type of software programming that while simple
algorithmically, has many challenges from data-transformation and
configuration management perspective.
Traditional solutions in this area make extensive use of mapping UI
tools. Using Lua we solved this problem in a different manner by
building a specialized IDE that has a high emphasis on visibility of the
data flowing through the code in real time.
The talk will focus on why we chose Lua for the task and what we found
we could do given our focus on particular subset of software development
problems.</DIV>
