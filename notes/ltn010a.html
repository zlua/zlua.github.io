This note was inspired by Anna Hester's HTMLToolkit and 
Roberto Ierusalimschy's Technical Note 9 on the inefficiencies of
concatenating strings. The mathematical abstraction that underlies
grammars and the structure of, for example HTML documents, is that  
of a tree. We present here a short Lua program, called weave, for
building trees out of descriptions and writing them out. This
document, for example, is constructed by weave adapted to HTML.
The big drawback of HTML is that it has neither variables nor
abstraction facilities. I make all my web pages with weave now.<a href="#source"> The weave source of this web page is shown below.</a>

<p>
By a 'tree' we mean a table, whose indices are integers,
and whose values are either strings (leaves of the tree) or trees.
Here is the function 'node' which constructs trees. It has two
methods, 'push' and 'walk'. Push inserts a new string or tree.
Walk applies a function recursively to the leaves.<b><tt><pre> 

node = function (list)
       local a
       if list then 
         a = list
         a.n = getn(list)
       else a = { n = 0 } end -- if
       if not a.push then
         a.push = function (self,x) tinsert(self,x) end
       end -- if
       if not a.walk then  
        a.walk = function (self,f)
                 local b
                 for i = 1,self.n do
                   b = self[i]
                   if type(b) == "string" then f(b)
                   else b:walk(f) end -- if
                 end -- for
               end -- function
       end -- if        
       return a
       end -- function
       
</pre>
</tt>
</b>
This is the core of weave. Then some specific definitions
are required to interpret the structure in question, in this case
HTML. It makes sense to modularise weave by reading in these
definitions using dofile. The final part of weave writes out the
leaves to its output, 'out', which I am presuming is specified by the
document being processed (which is given by 'arg[1]'). Here it is:<b><tt><pre>

page,out = PAGE(dofile(arg[1])) -- read the page description
assert(page,"Cannot read "..arg[1])
writeto(out)
page:walk(write) -- write the HTML file
writeto() 

</pre>
</tt>
</b>
It remains to describe the HTML-specific part of weave,
and, in particular, the function PAGE. This function takes three
arguments, the title, the pathname of the file that the document is to 
reside in, and the tree describing the body of the document. It 
outputs the whole tree and the pathname.<b><tt><pre>

PAGE = function (title, saveas, body)
       local x = node {
       [[&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"&gt;]],
       HTML { 
              HEAD {
                   [[&lt;meta name="MSSmartTagsPreventParsing" content="TRUE"&gt;]],
                   TITLE { title }
<LINK REL="stylesheet" TYPE="text/css" HREF="../lua.css">
                    }, -- HEAD   
             BODY(body)
            } -- HTML
                    } -- node
       return x,saveas
       end -- function 
       
</pre>
</tt>
</b>
We have used the convention of using upper case versions of
HTML tag names for constructors (i.e. nodes of the tree) to contrast
with lower case variable names for the user to choose for their
arguments, much in the style of Haskell. These are defined by:<b><tt><pre>

tag = function (name,attr)
      local f = function (obj)
                  local n,att,x = %name,%attr,node()
                  x:push "&lt;"
                  x:push(n)
                  if att then
                    x:push " "
                    x:push(att)
                  end -- if
                  x:push "&gt;"
                  x:push(node(obj))
                  x:push "&lt;/"
                  x:push(n)
                  x:push "&gt;\n"
                return x  
                end -- function
      return f
      end -- function        

monotags = { "p","b","hr" }

for _,s in monotags do
  setglobal(strupper(s),"\n&lt;"..s.."&gt;\n")
end -- for                

tagwords = { "html","head","body","title","center",
             "h1","h2","h3","h4","h5","h6","tt","b",
             "ul","ol","li","dl","dd","dt","tr","td",
             "th","pre","small"} 
             
for _,s in tagwords do             
 setglobal(strupper(s),tag(s))
end -- for  

</pre>
</tt>
</b>
You can probably now write your own definitions for
anchors, images and other bits of HTML. A useful non-HTML addition
is the facility to INCLUDE another file as a piece of text in
the document.<b><tt><pre>

INCLUDE = function (fname)
           readfrom(fname)
           local text = read("*a")
           readfrom()
           return text
          end -- function
