Technical Note 2
</H1>

<H2>Minimal Lua 4.0 installations</H2>

This note explains
how to build Lua for environments that do not have much memory,
such as embedded systems.
This is a version of
<A HREF="ltn001.html">Technical Note 1</A>,
updated for Lua 4.0.
<P>

As explicitly stated in the
<A HREF="../about.html">"about" page</A>,
one of the goals of our Lua implementation is
<EM>low embedding cost</EM>.
This means two things:
first,
it should be easy to embed Lua in an application;
second,
the additional code for Lua should not be too large.
<P>

The first requirement is fulfilled by the simplicity of Lua's C API.
The second requirement is fulfilled by demonstration,
as follows.
<P>

Here are a few numbers for Lua 4.0,
compiled with the default options
in an Intel machine running Linux
(the numbers for other platforms will be different, but probably
roughly the same in relative terms):

</PRE>
In this listing,
<CODE>text</CODE> actually is the size of the code in bytes.
We conclude that
the Lua core (<CODE>liblua.a</CODE>) takes 41746 bytes and that
the Lua standard libraries (<CODE>liblualib.a</CODE>) take 22528 bytes.
So,
the whole Lua code takes 64274 bytes, or less than 63K.
In other words,
the impact of Lua in an application is 63K of additional code,
which is quite small.
(Of course, Lua will use memory at run-time -- but how much depends on the
application.)
<P>

63K seem very little
in these days that machines have many megabytes of main memory,
but they might make a difference for someone trying to use Lua in a microwave
oven or in a robot.
So,
let's see how to reduce these 63K to even less.
(Even if you're not using Lua in embedded systems,
you might learn something from the description below.)
<P>

The first thing is to remove any standard libraries that are not needed.
For instance,
<CODE>ldblib.o</CODE> will probably not be needed in most applications,
and <CODE>liolib.o</CODE> will probably not make sense for a microwave oven.
But removing standard libraries will not get you very far,
because they are small already.
So,
let's look at the numbers for the core again, but now sorted by size:
<PRE>
text    %core   %whole   filename
   0     0%      0%      ltests.o
 225     1%      0%      lmem.o
 336     1%      1%      lzio.o
 574     1%      1%      lfunc.o
 598     1%      1%      lstate.o
 734     2%      1%      lobject.o
 953     2%      1%      lstring.o
1495     4%      2%      ltm.o
1651     4%      3%      ltable.o
1874     4%      3%      lgc.o
2372     6%      4%      ldo.o
2491     6%      4%      lundump.o
3031     7%      5%      ldebug.o
3328     8%      5%      lapi.o
4054    10%      6%      lcode.o
4909    12%      8%      llex.o
5487    13%      9%      lvm.o
7634    18%     12%      lparser.o
</PRE>
This listing tells us that the parsing modules --
the lexer <CODE>llex.o</CODE>,
the parser <CODE>lparser.o</CODE>,
and the code generator
<CODE>lcode.o</CODE> --
represent 40% of the core (and 26% of the whole).
So,
they are the main candidates for removal.
An application that does not need to compile Lua code at run-time does
not need the parsing modules.
<P>

We have designed the code so that it is easy to remove these three modules.
Only one module (<CODE>ldo.o</CODE>) calls the parser,
which has only one public function (<CODE>luaY_parser</CODE>).
The only module that calls the lexer is the parser,
except for an initialization function (<CODE>luaX_init</CODE>) used
in <CODE>lua_open</CODE>.
The only module that calls the code generator is the parser,
except that
<CODE>ldebug.o</CODE> uses the array
<CODE>luaK_opproperties</CODE>
from <CODE>lcode.o</CODE>.
So,
to remove the parsing modules
you only need to add the code below to your application
(you can extract it from <CODE>lua/src/luac/stubs.c</CODE>,
where it is disabled by default):
<PRE>
#include "llex.h"
#include "lparser.h"

void luaX_init(lua_State *L) {
  UNUSED(L);
}

Proto *luaY_parser(lua_State *L, ZIO *z) {
  UNUSED(z);
  lua_error(L,"parser not loaded");
  return NULL;
}
</PRE>
To remove the code generator too,
you need to
add <CODE>#include "lcode.h"</CODE> and
copy <CODE>luaK_opproperties</CODE> from <CODE>lcode.c</CODE>
into this code.
<P>

An application that contains the code above will not link the parsing modules
and
trying to load Lua source code will generate an error.
But then,
you ask,
how does the application load Lua code at all?
The answer is:
by loading precompiled chunks instead of source code.
Precompiled chunks are created with <CODE>luac</CODE>,
which <EM>will</EM> contain the parsing modules,
but which is an external application.
The module that loads precompiled chunks is <CODE>lundump.o</CODE>,
which is small enough.
<P>

Although
<CODE>lua_dofile</CODE> and <CODE>dofile</CODE> automatically detect
precompiled chunks,
one convenient way is to use <CODE>lua_dobuffer</CODE>
with precompiled chunks statically linked to your application
(you will find <CODE>lua/etc/bin2c.c</CODE> useful for this),
because embedded systems don't even have filesystems.
(This is a quick solution,
but it will increase the size of your application
and it may be too inflexible for you.)
<P>

Removing the parsing modules
leaves us with a core of just 25296 bytes,
a little more than 24K.
This is tiny indeed for a powerful language like Lua!
Note also that
this reduction was done
without sacrificing any language features and
without touching the source code;
we just need a little help from the linker.
<P>

This note has focused on reducing the amount of code added to the application
by the Lua library.
Applications that need this will probably also prefer to use integers instead
of floating-point numbers for the numbers in Lua.
(Does a microwave oven need floating-point?)
This should be simple to do,
as described in <CODE>lua/config</CODE>,
but the details will probably be discussed in another LTN.
<P>
