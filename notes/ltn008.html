<H2>A fast multiple-inheritance tag method implementation in Lua</H2>
by <A HREF="http://mozart.chat.net/~jeske/">David Jeske</A>

<H2> Abstract </H2>

This note explains a multiple-inheritance style class system based on
Lua's tag methods which provides performance similar to languages such
as Python.

<H2> The Problem </H2>

Sometimes it's desirable to have an inheritance style class system to
compose Lua objects. A default single-inheritance scheme dubbed
"Inheritance via fallbacks"
[<A HREF="#1">1</A>]
is proposed in a short article on
using Lua. However, as inheritance chains become long, the time to
process repeated lookup walks up the parent chain used by this
implementation can become undesirable. In addition, sometime it's
convenient to have multiple-inheritance in addition to single
inheritance.

<H2> The Solution </H2>

A tag-method inheritance scheme is proposed which provides single and
multiple inheritance, and whose implementation drastically speeds up
access to inherited data and functions by caching them in a flat
hash-table similar to the way languages such as Python flatten
inheritance into a single table. This optimized version of the
machinery assumes that you will not change base-class methods at
run-time.

<P>
The non-caching implementation is rather simple. It uses a
<tt>_parents = {}</tt> member in a table to create an inheritance
chain.

	   cur_data = p[cur_index];

I normally setup this fallback tag method for all-tables, which means
that creating inheritance is as simple as creating tables with the
appropriate members:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>
a_base = {
  a_number = 1
}

b_base = {
  b_number = 2
}

ab_class = {
  _parents = { a_base, b_base }
}

print(ab_class.a_number); -- yields "1"
print(ab_class.b_number); -- yields "2"
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

Using the simple implementation above, it's easy to create inheritance
chains which severely impact run-time performance, because an
inherited method call or instance data access can result in
<tt>2n</tt> lookups, where <tt>n</tt> is the number of base classes
inherited from in the whole chain.

<P>
A performance optimized implementation is provided which functions the
mostly same but is drastically faster.

-- AdvProtoIndexWithCache
--
-- This inheritance tag method handles multiple inheritance via a
-- "_parent = {}" table. It caches information in the top-level table
-- to make lookups fast.
--
-- Example:
--
-- This tag method is applied to all tables, so all you have to do to
-- get a magic inheritance table is to do this:
--
-- BaseObj1 = { a_value = "a" }
-- BaseObj2 = { b_value = "b" }
-- MyClass  = { _parents = { BaseObj2, BaseObj1 } }
-- MyInstance = { _parents = { MyClass }
--

    -- I like to setup my tag methods within a function because
    -- then stuff like these private declarations can be
    -- referenced with upvalues and disappear. :)

<H2> Explanation </H2>

The final implementation uses a "_slotcache" table which is creates in
any target of a method call. Anytime a method lookup via the
<tt>_parents</tt> multiple inheritance machinery results in a positive
lookup, the result is stored in the original target's "_slotcache".

<P>
In the cache, functions are pointed to directly, and other items are
pointed to using something called a "SLOT_REF". A SLOT_REF is a
special kind of table which is a cache by reference instead of by
value. It contains a reference to the table and index of the original
value so that if the original data value changes, this SLOT_REF will
correctly point to the new data-value. This is not done for methods,
because it was decided that performance of method lookups is more
important than retaining the ability to change methods in
base-classes. 

<P>
Another implementation of this machinery could be even faster by
doing away with SLOT_REF, and instead using some method to invalidate
slotcaches (such as maintaining a reverse-slotcache dependency
list). Whenever a base-class method or function was changed, the
reverse dependency chain's slotcaches would be invalidated. This would
probably result in only moderate extra data-keeping if the
"_slotcache" were changed to occur at the "class" level of the object
instead of the "instance" level as it does now.

<H2> Weaknesses </H2>

Because <i>nil</i> in Lua is overridden as the meaning for both false
and an absent data-value, some trickery was added to correctly cache
inherited <i>nil</i> values. Without this, any instance data or method
which is intended to be either missing or false causes the expensive
<tt>_parents</tt> lookup to occur each time. Since the assumption is
made that base classes will never be changed, this is a safe
optimization. Even when a 'cached NIL' value is present in the
<tt>_slotcache</tt>, setting an instance member to some other value
will override the 'cached NIL', because the <tt>_slotcache</tt> is
only consulted when lookup in the instance table misses.


<P>
It's important to recognize that because the caching version stores
information directly in a single flattened table, changes to the base
class methods may be ignored if they are already in the cached
table. In practice, changing methods of a base class is an infrequent
operation. When using this machinery, one should avoid this practice
entirely.

<P>

Because Lua (IMO mistakenly) overrides <i>nil</i> as meaning both
false and an empty data element, there is no way to override an
inherited object member with the nil value. This is because setting
<tt>self.a = nil</tt> will result in the removal of the "a" member,
thus causing the missing-index tag method to fire, which consults the
<tt>_parents</tt> or <tt>_slotcache</tt> tables to find an inherited
element "a". I've not yet found a workaround for this problem.

<H2> Conclusion </H2>

This note explains a performance optimized method of implementing
multiple inheritance using Lua's built in tag methods. This makes it
possible to make larger and more useful class hierarchies in Lua,
without incurring the significant performance penalties of the
simplistic 'parent lookup every time' implementation.
