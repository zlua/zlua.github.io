<h2><a name="lexical">1.3 &ndash; Some Lexical Conventions</a></h2>

<p>
Identifiers in Lua can be any string of letters,
digits, and underscores,
not beginning with a digit;
for instance
<pre>
    i      j       i10      _ij
    aSomewhatLongName    _INPUT
</pre>
You should avoid identifiers starting with an underscore followed by
one or more uppercase letters (e.g., <code>_VERSION</code>);
they are reserved for special uses in Lua.
Usually,
I reserve the identifier <code>_</code> (a single underscore)
for a dummy variable.

<p>In Lua, the concept of what is a letter is locale dependent.
Therefore, with a proper locale, you can use variable names such as
<code>&iacute;ndice</code> or <code>a&ccedil;&atilde;o</code>.
However, such names will make your program unsuitable to run in
systems that do not support that locale.

<p>The following words are reserved;
we cannot use them as identifiers:
<pre>
    and       break     do        else      elseif
    end       false     for       function  if
    in        local     nil       not       or
    repeat    return    then      true      until
    while
</pre>
Lua is case-sensitive:
<b>and</b> is a reserved word, but <code>And</code> and <code>AND</code>
are two other different identifiers.

<p>A comment starts anywhere with a double hyphen (<code>--</code>)
and runs until the end of the line.
Lua also offers block comments,
which start with <code>--[[</code> and run until the corresponding <code>]]</code>.
A common trick,
when we want to comment out a piece of code,
is to write the following:
<pre>
    --[[
    print(10)         -- no action (comment)
    --]]
</pre>
Now, if we add a single hyphen to the first line,
the code is in again:
<pre>
    ---[[
    print(10)         --> 10
    --]]
</pre>
In the first example, the <code>--</code> in the last line
is still inside the block comment.
In the second example, the sequence <code>---[[</code> does not start
a block comment;
so, the <code>print</code> is outside comments.
In this case, the last line becomes an independent comment,
as it starts with <code>--</code>.
