<h2>19.1 &ndash; Array Size</h2>

<p>Frequently, in Lua,
we assume that an array ends just before its first nil element.
This convention has one drawback:
We cannot have a <B>nil</B> inside an array.
For several applications this restriction is not a hindrance,
such as when all elements in the array have a fixed type.
But sometimes we must allow <B>nil</B>s inside an array.
In such cases, we need a method to keep an explicit size for an array.

<p>The table library defines two functions to
manipulate array sizes:
<code>getn</code>, which returns the size of an array,
and <code>setn</code>, which sets the size of an array.
As we saw earlier, there are two methods to
associate an attribute to a table:
Either we store the attribute in a field of the table,
or we use a separate (weak) table to do the association.
Both methods have pros and cons;
for that reason, the <code>table</code> library uses both.

<p>Usually, a call <code>table.setn(t, n)</code>
associates <code>t</code> with <code>n</code> in an internal (weak) table
and a call <code>table.getn(t)</code> retrieves the value associated with <code>t</code>
in that internal table.
However, if the table <code>t</code> has a field <code>"n"</code> with a numeric value,
<code>setn</code> updates this value and <code>getn</code> returns it.
The <code>getn</code> function still has a last option:
If it cannot get an array size with any of those options,
it uses the naive approach:
to traverse the array looking for its first nil element.
So, you can always use <code>table.getn(t)</code> in an array
and get a reasonable result.
See the examples:
<pre>
    print(table.getn{10,2,4})          --> 3
    print(table.getn{10,2,nil})        --> 2
    print(table.getn{10,2,nil; n=3})   --> 3
    print(table.getn{n=1000})          --> 1000
    
    a = {}
    print(table.getn(a))               --> 0
    table.setn(a, 10000)
    print(table.getn(a))               --> 10000
    
    a = {n=10}
    print(table.getn(a))               --> 10
    table.setn(a, 10000)
    print(table.getn(a))               --> 10000
</pre>

<p>By default, <code>setn</code> and <code>getn</code>
use the internal table to store a size.
This is the cleanest option,
as it does not pollute the array with an extra element.
However, the <code>n</code>-field option has some advantages too.
The Lua core uses this option to set the size of the <code>arg</code> array,
in functions with variable number of arguments;
because the core cannot depend on a library,
it cannot use <code>setn</code>.
Another advantage of this option is that we can set the size
of an array directly in its constructor, as we saw in the examples.

<p>It is a good practice to use both <code>setn</code> and <code>getn</code> to
manipulate array sizes, even when you know that the size is
at field <code>n</code>.
All functions from the <code>table</code> library
(<code>sort</code>, <code>concat</code>, <code>insert</code>, etc.)
follow this practice.
Actually,
the possibility of <code>setn</code> to change the value of the field <code>n</code>
is provided only for compatibility with older versions of Lua.
This behavior may change in future versions of the language.
To play safe, do not assume this behavior.
Always use <code>getn</code> to get a size set by <code>setn</code>.
