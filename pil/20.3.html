<h2>20.3 &ndash; Captures</h2>

<p>The <em>capture</em> mechanism allows a pattern to yank parts of
the subject string that match parts of the pattern, for further use.
You specify a capture by writing the parts of
the pattern that you want to capture between parentheses.

<p>When you specify captures to <code>string.find</code>,
it returns the captured values as extra results from the call.
A typical use of this facility is to break a string into parts:
<pre>
    pair = "name = Anna"
    _, _, key, value = string.find(pair, "(%a+)%s*=%s*(%a+)")
    print(key, value)  --> name  Anna
</pre>
The pattern '<code>%a+</code>' specifies a non-empty sequence of letters;
the pattern '<code>%s*</code>' specifies a possibly empty sequence of spaces.
So, in the example above,
the whole pattern specifies a sequence of letters,
followed by a sequence of spaces,
followed by `<code>=</code>&acute;, again followed by spaces plus
another sequence of letters.
Both sequences of letters have their patterns enclosed by parentheses,
so that they will be captured if a match occurs.
The <code>find</code> function always returns first the indices where
the matching happened
(which we store in the dummy variable <code>_</code> in the previous example)
and then the captures made during the pattern matching.
Below is a similar example:
<pre>
    date = "17/7/1990"
    _, _, d, m, y = string.find(date, "(%d+)/(%d+)/(%d+)")
    print(d, m, y)  --> 17  7  1990
</pre>

<p>We can also use captures in the pattern itself.
In a pattern,
an item like '<code>%<em>d</em></code>', where <em>d</em> is a single digit,
matches only a copy of the <em>d</em>-th capture.
As a typical use, suppose you want to find, inside a string,
a substring enclosed between single or double quotes.
You could try a pattern such as '<code>["'].-["']</code>',
that is, a quote followed by anything followed by another quote;
but you would have problems with strings like
<code>"it's all right"</code>.
To solve that problem, you can capture the first quote
and use it to specify the second one:
<pre>
    s = [[then he said: "it's all right"!]]
    a, b, c, quotedPart = string.find(s, "([\"'])(.-)%1")
    print(quotedPart)   --> it's all right
    print(c)            --> "
</pre>
The first capture is the quote character itself
and the second capture is the contents of the quote
(the substring matching the '<code>.-</code>').

<p>The third use of captured values is in the
replacement string of <code>gsub</code>.
Like the pattern,
the replacement string may contain items like '<code>%<em>d</em></code>',
which are changed to the respective captures when the
substitution is made.
(By the way, because of those changes,
a `<code>%</code>&acute; in the replacement string must be escaped as <code>"%%"</code>.)
As an example,
the following command duplicates every letter in a string,
with a hyphen between the copies:
<pre>
    print(string.gsub("hello Lua!", "(%a)", "%1-%1"))
      -->  h-he-el-ll-lo-o L-Lu-ua-a!
</pre>
This one interchanges adjacent characters:
<pre>
    print(string.gsub("hello Lua", "(.)(.)", "%2%1"))
      -->  ehll ouLa
</pre>

<p>As a more useful example, let us write a primitive format converter,
which gets a string with commands written in a LaTeX style,
such as
<pre>
    \command{some text}
</pre>
and changes them to a format in XML style,
<pre>
    &lt;command>some text&lt;/command>
</pre>
For this specification, the following line does the job:
<pre>
    s = string.gsub(s, "\\(%a+){(.-)}", "&lt;%1>%2&lt;/%1>")
</pre>
For instance, if <code>s</code> is the string
<pre>
    the \quote{task} is to \em{change} that.
</pre>
that <code>gsub</code> call will change it to
<pre>
    the &lt;quote>task&lt;/quote> is to &lt;em>change&lt;/em> that.
</pre>
Another useful example is how to trim a string:
<pre>
    function trim (s)
      return (string.gsub(s, "^%s*(.-)%s*$", "%1"))
    end
</pre>
Note the judicious use of pattern formats.
The two anchors (`<code>^</code>&acute; and `<code>$</code>&acute;) ensure that we get the whole string.
Because the '<code>.-</code>' tries to expand as little as possible,
the two patterns '<code>%s*</code>' match all spaces at both extremities.
Note also that, because <code>gsub</code> returns two values,
we use extra parentheses to discard the extra result (the count).

<p>The last use of captured values is perhaps the most powerful.
We can call <code>string.gsub</code> with a function as
its third argument, instead of a replacement string.
When invoked this way, <code>string.gsub</code> calls the given
function every time it finds a match;
the arguments to this function are the captures,
while the value that the function returns is used as the replacement string.
As a first example,
the following function does <em>variable expansion</em>:
It substitutes the value of the global variable <code>varname</code>
for every occurrence of <code>$varname</code> in a string:
<pre>
    function expand (s)
      s = string.gsub(s, "$(%w+)", function (n)
            return _G[n]
          end)
      return s
    end
    
    name = "Lua"; status = "great"
    print(expand("$name is $status, isn't it?"))
      --> Lua is great, isn't it?
</pre>
If you are not sure whether the given variables have string values,
you can apply <code>tostring</code> to their values:
<pre>
    function expand (s)
      return (string.gsub(s, "$(%w+)", function (n)
                return tostring(_G[n])
              end))
    end
    
    print(expand("print = $print; a = $a"))
      --> print = function: 0x8050ce0; a = nil
</pre>

<p>A more powerful example uses <code>loadstring</code> to evaluate
whole expressions that we write in the text
enclosed by square brackets preceded by a dollar sign:
<pre>
    s = "sin(3) = $[math.sin(3)]; 2^5 = $[2^5]"
    
    print((string.gsub(s, "$(%b[])", function (x)
             x = "return " .. string.sub(x, 2, -2)
             local f = loadstring(x)
             return f()
           end)))
      -->  sin(3) = 0.1411200080598672; 2^5 = 32
</pre>
The first match is the string <code>"$[math.sin(3)]"</code>,
whose corresponding capture is <code>"[math.sin(3)]"</code>.
The call to <code>string.sub</code> removes the brackets from the captured string,
so the string loaded for execution will be
<code>"return math.sin(3)"</code>.
The same happens for the match <code>"$[2^5]"</code>.

<p>Often we want a kind of <code>string.gsub</code> only
to iterate on a string,
without any interest in the resulting string.
For instance, we could collect the words of a string into a table
with the following code:
<pre>
    words = {}
    string.gsub(s, "(%a+)", function (w)
      table.insert(words, w)
    end)
</pre>
If <code>s</code> were the string <code>"hello hi, again!"</code>,
after that command the <code>word</code> table would be
<pre>
    {"hello", "hi", "again"}
</pre>
The <code>string.gfind</code> function offers
a simpler way to write that code:
<pre>
    words = {}
    for w in string.gfind(s, "(%a)") do
      table.insert(words, w)
    end
</pre>
The <code>gfind</code> function fits perfectly with the generic <b>for</b> loop.
It returns a function that iterates on all occurrences of
a pattern in a string.

<p>We can simplify that code a little bit more.
When we call <code>gfind</code> with a pattern without any explicit capture,
the function will capture the whole pattern.
Therefore, we can rewrite the previous example like this:
<pre>
    words = {}
    for w in string.gfind(s, "%a") do
      table.insert(words, w)
    end
</pre>

<p>For our next example,
we use <em>URL encoding</em>,
which is the encoding used by HTTP to send parameters in a URL.
This encoding encodes special characters
(such as `<code>=</code>&acute;, `<code>&amp;</code>&acute;, and `<code>+</code>&acute;) as <code>"%<em>XX</em>"</code>,
where <em>XX</em> is the hexadecimal representation of the character.
Then, it changes spaces to `<code>+</code>&acute;.
For instance, it encodes the string <code>"a+b = c"</code> as <code>"a%2Bb+%3D+c"</code>.
Finally, it writes each parameter name and parameter
value with an `<code>=</code>&acute; in between
and appends all pairs <code>name=value</code>
with an ampersand in-between.
For instance, the values
<pre>
    name = "al";  query = "a+b = c"; q="yes or no"
</pre>
are encoded as
<pre>
    name=al&amp;query=a%2Bb+%3D+c&amp;q=yes+or+no
</pre>
Now, suppose we want to decode this URL
and store each value in a table, indexed by its corresponding name.
The following function does the basic decoding:
<pre>
    function unescape (s)
      s = string.gsub(s, "+", " ")
      s = string.gsub(s, "%%(%x%x)", function (h)
            return string.char(tonumber(h, 16))
          end)
      return s
    end
</pre>
The first statement changes each `<code>+</code>&acute; in the string to a space.
The second <code>gsub</code> matches all two-digit hexadecimal numerals
preceded by `<code>%</code>&acute; and calls an anonymous function.
That function converts the hexadecimal numeral into a number
(<code>tonumber</code>, with base 16)
and returns the corresponding character (<code>string.char</code>).
For instance,
<pre>
    print(unescape("a%2Bb+%3D+c"))  --> a+b = c
</pre>

<p>To decode the pairs <code>name=value</code> we use <code>gfind</code>.
Because both names and values cannot contain either `<code>&amp;</code>&acute; or `<code>=</code>&acute;,
we can match them with the pattern '<code>[^&amp;=]+</code>':
<pre>
    cgi = {}
    function decode (s)
      for name, value in string.gfind(s, "([^&amp;=]+)=([^&amp;=]+)") do
        name = unescape(name)
        value = unescape(value)
        cgi[name] = value
      end
    end
</pre>
That call to <code>gfind</code> matches all pairs in the form <code>name=value</code>
and, for each pair, the iterator returns the corresponding captures
(as marked by the parentheses in the matching string)
as the values to <code>name</code> and <code>value</code>.
The loop body simply calls <code>unescape</code> on both strings
and stores the pair in the <code>cgi</code> table.

<p>The corresponding encoding is also easy to write.
First, we write the <code>escape</code> function;
this function encodes all special characters as a `<code>%</code>&acute;
followed by the character ASCII code in hexadecimal
(the <code>format</code> option <code>"%02X"</code> makes
an hexadecimal number with two digits,
using 0 for padding),
and then changes spaces to `<code>+</code>&acute;:
<pre>
    function escape (s)
      s = string.gsub(s, "([&amp;=+%c])", function (c)
            return string.format("%%%02X", string.byte(c))
          end)
      s = string.gsub(s, " ", "+")
      return s
    end
</pre>
The <code>encode</code> function traverses the table to be encoded,
building the resulting string:
<pre>
    function encode (t)
      local s = ""
      for k,v in pairs(t) do
        s = s .. "&amp;" .. escape(k) .. "=" .. escape(v)
      end
      return string.sub(s, 2)     -- remove first `&amp;'
    end
    
    t = {name = "al",  query = "a+b = c", q="yes or no"}
    print(encode(t)) --> q=yes+or+no&amp;query=a%2Bb+%3D+c&amp;name=al
</pre>
