<h3>4.3.5 &ndash; Generic <b>for</b></h3>

<p>The generic <b>for</b> loop allows you to traverse all values
returned by an iterator function.
We have already seen examples of the generic <b>for</b>:
<pre>
    -- print all values of array `a'
    for i,v in ipairs(a) do print(v) end
</pre>
For each step in that code, <code>i</code> gets an index,
while <code>v</code> gets the value associated with that index.
A similar example shows how we traverse all keys of a table:
<pre>
    -- print all keys of table `t'
    for k in pairs(t) do print(k) end
</pre>
Despite its apparent simplicity,
the generic <b>for</b> is powerful.
With proper iterators,
we can traverse almost anything,
and do it in a readable fashion.
The standard libraries provide several iterators,
which allow us to iterate over the lines of a file
(<code>io.lines</code>),
the pairs in a table (<code>pairs</code>),
the words of a string
(<code>string.gfind</code>, which we will see in <a href="20.html#StringLib">Chapter 20</a>),
and so on.
Of course, we can write our own iterators.
Although the use of the generic <b>for</b> is easy,
the task of writing iterator functions has its subtleties.
We will cover this topic later, in <a href="7.html#GenericFor">Chapter 7</a>.

<p>The generic loop shares two properties with the numeric loop:
The loop variables are local to the loop body
and you should never assign any value to the loop variables.

<p>Let us see a more concrete example of the use
of a generic <b>for</b>.
Suppose you have a table with the names of the days of the week:
<pre>
    days = {"Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
            "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"}
</pre>
Now you want to translate a name into its position in the week.
You can search the table, looking for the given name.
Frequently, however,
a more efficient approach in Lua is to build a <em>reverse table</em>,
say <code>revDays</code>,
that has the names as indices and the numbers as values.
That table would look like this:
<pre>
    revDays = {["Sunday"] = 1, ["Monday"] = 2,
                ["Tuesday"] = 3, ["Wednesday"] = 4,
                ["Thursday"] = 5, ["Friday"] = 6,
                ["Saturday"] = 7}
</pre>
Then, all you have to do to find the order of a name
is to index this reverse table:
<pre>
    x = "Tuesday"
    print(revDays[x])    --> 3
</pre>
Of course, we do not need to manually declare the reverse table.
We can build it automatically from the original one:
<pre>
    revDays = {}
    for i,v in ipairs(days) do
      revDays[v] = i
    end
</pre>
The loop will do the assignment for each element of <code>days</code>,
with the variable <code>i</code> getting the index (1, 2, ...) and
<code>v</code> the value (<code>"Sunday"</code>, <code>"Monday"</code>, ...).
