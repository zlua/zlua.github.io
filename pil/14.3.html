<h2>14.3 &ndash; Non-Global Environments</h2>

<p>One of the problems with the environment is that it is global.
Any modification you do on it affects all parts of your program.
For instance, when you install a metatable to control global access,
your whole program must follow the guidelines.
If you want to use a library that uses
global variables without declaring them,
you are in bad luck.

<p>Lua 5.0 ameliorates this problem by allowing each
function to have its own environment.
That may sound strange at first;
after all, the goal of a table of global variables is to be global.
However, in <a href="15.4.html#package-env">Section 15.4</a> we will see that this facility allows
several interesting constructions,
where global values are still available everywhere.

<p>You can change the environment of a function with the
<code>setfenv</code> function (<em>set function environment</em>).
It receives the function and the new environment.
Instead of the function itself,
you can also give a number,
meaning the active function at that given stack level.
Number 1 means the current function,
number 2 means the function calling the current function
(which is handy to write auxiliary functions that change
the environment of their caller),
and so on.

<p>A naive first attempt to use <code>setfenv</code> fails miserably.
The code
<pre>
    a = 1   -- create a global variable
    -- change current environment to a new empty table
    setfenv(1, {})
    print(a)
</pre>
results in
<pre>
    stdin:5: attempt to call global `print' (a nil value)
</pre>
(You must run that code in a single chunk.
If you enter it line by line in interactive mode,
each line is a different function
and the call to <code>setfenv</code> only affects its own line.)
Once you change your environment,
all global accesses will use this new table.
If it is empty, you lost all your global variables,
even <code>_G</code>.
So, you should first populate it with some useful values,
such as the old environment:
<pre>
    a = 1   -- create a global variable
    -- change current environment
    setfenv(1, {_G = _G})
    _G.print(a)      --> nil
    _G.print(_G.a)   --> 1
</pre>
Now, when you access the "global" <code>_G</code>,
its value is the old environment,
wherein you will find the field <code>print</code>.

<p>You can populate your new environment using inheritance also:
<pre>
    a = 1
    local newgt = {}        -- create new environment
    setmetatable(newgt, {__index = _G})
    setfenv(1, newgt)    -- set it
    print(a)          --> 1
</pre>
In this code,
the new environment inherits both <code>print</code> and <code>a</code> from
the old one.
Nevertheless, any assignment goes to the new table.
There is no danger of changing a really global variable by mistake,
although you still can change them through <code>_G</code>:
<pre>
    -- continuing previous code
    a = 10
    print(a)      --> 10
    print(_G.a)   --> 1
    _G.a = 20
    print(_G.a)   --> 20
</pre>

<p>When you create a new function,
it inherits its environment from the function creating it.
Therefore, if a chunk changes its own environment,
all functions it defines afterward will share this same environment.
This is a useful mechanism for creating namespaces,
as we will see in the next chapter.
