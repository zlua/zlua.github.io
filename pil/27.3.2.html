<h3><a name="references">27.3.2 &ndash; References</a></h3>

<p>You should never use numbers as keys in the registry,
because such keys are reserved for the <em>reference system</em>.
This system is composed by a couple of functions in the auxiliary
library that allow you to store values in the registry without
worrying about how to create unique names.
(Actually, those functions can act on any table,
but they are typically used with the registry.)

<p>The call
<pre>
    int r = luaL_ref(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX);
</pre>
pops a value from the stack, stores it into the registry
with a fresh integer key, and returns that key.
We call this key a <em>reference</em>.

<p>As the name implies,
we use references mainly when we need to store a reference
to a Lua value inside a C structure.
As we have seen, we should never store pointers to Lua strings
outside the C function that retrieved them.
Moreover, Lua does not even offer pointers to other objects,
such as tables or functions.
So, we cannot refer to Lua objects through pointers.
Instead, when we need such pointers,
we create a reference and store it in C.

<p>To push the value associated with a reference <code>r</code> onto the stack,
we simply write
<pre>
    lua_rawgeti(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, r);
</pre>
Finally, to release both the value and the reference,
we call
<pre>
    luaL_unref(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, r);
</pre>
After this call, <code>luaL_ref</code> may return the value
in <code>r</code> again as a new reference.

<p>The reference system treats <B>nil</B> as a special case.
Whenever you call <code>luaL_ref</code> for a nil value,
it does not create a new reference,
but instead returns the constant reference <code>LUA_REFNIL</code>.
The call
<pre>
    luaL_unref(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, LUA_REFNIL);
</pre>
has no effect, whereas
<pre>
    lua_rawgeti(L, LUA_REGISTRYINDEX, LUA_REFNIL);
</pre>
pushes a <B>nil</B>, as expected.

<p>The reference system also defines the constant <code>LUA_NOREF</code>,
which is an integer different from any valid reference.
It is useful to mark references as invalid.
As with <code>LUA_REFNIL</code>,
any attempt to retrieve <code>LUA_NOREF</code> returns <B>nil</B>
and any attempt to release it has no effect.
