<h2><a name="xpcall">8.5 &ndash; Error Messages and Tracebacks</a></h2>

<p>Although you can use a value of any type as an error message,
usually error messages are strings describing what went wrong.
When there is an internal error
(such as an attempt to index a non-table value),
Lua generates the error message;
otherwise, the error message is the value passed to
the <code>error</code> function.
In any case,
Lua tries to add some information about the location
where the error happened:
<pre>
    local status, err = pcall(function () a = 'a'+1 end)
    print(err)
     --> stdin:1: attempt to perform arithmetic on a string value
    
    local status, err = pcall(function () error("my error") end)
    print(err)
     --> stdin:1: my error
</pre>
The location information gives the file name
(<code>stdin</code>, in the example)
plus the line number (1, in the example).

<p>The <code>error</code> function has an additional second parameter,
which gives the <em>level</em> where it should report the error;
with it, you can blame someone else for the error.
For instance, suppose you write a function
and its first task is to check whether it was called correctly:
<pre>
    function foo (str)
      if type(str) ~= "string" then
        error("string expected")
      end
      ...
    end
</pre>
Then, someone calls your function with a wrong argument:
<pre>
    foo({x=1})
</pre>
Lua points its finger to your function---after all,
it was <code>foo</code> that called <code>error</code>---and not to the real culprit,
the caller.
To correct that, you inform <code>error</code> that the error you
are reporting occurred on level 2 in the calling hierarchy
(level 1 is your own function):
<pre>
    function foo (str)
      if type(str) ~= "string" then
        error("string expected", 2)
      end
      ...
    end
</pre>

<p>Frequently, when an error happens,
we want more debug information than only the
location where the error occurred.
At least, we want a traceback,
showing the complete stack of calls leading to the error.
When <code>pcall</code> returns its error message,
it destroys part of the stack
(the part that went from it to the error point).
Consequently, if we want a traceback,
we must build it before <code>pcall</code> returns.
To do that, Lua provides the <code>xpcall</code> function.
Besides the function to be called,
it receives a second argument, an <em>error handler function</em>.
In case of errors,
Lua calls that error handler <em>before the stack unwinds</em>,
so that it can use the debug library to gather any extra
information it wants about the error.
Two common error handlers are <code>debug.debug</code>,
which gives you a Lua prompt so that you can inspect by
yourself what was going on when the error happened
(later we will see more about that, when we discuss the debug library);
and <code>debug.traceback</code>,
which builds an extended error message with a traceback.
The latter is the function that the
stand-alone interpreter uses to build its error messages.
You also can call <code>debug.traceback</code> at any moment to get a
traceback of the current execution:
<pre>
    print(debug.traceback())
</pre>
