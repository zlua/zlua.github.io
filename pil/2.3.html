<h2>2.3 &ndash; Numbers</h2>

<p>The number type represents real
(double-precision floating-point) numbers.
Lua has no integer type, as it does not need it.
There is a widespread misconception about
floating-point arithmetic errors
and some people fear that even a simple increment can go weird with
floating-point numbers.
The fact is that,
when you use a double to represent an integer,
there is no rounding error at all
(unless the number is greater than 100,000,000,000,000).
Specifically, a Lua number can represent any long integer
without rounding problems.
Moreover, most modern CPUs do floating-point arithmetic as fast as
(or even faster than) integer arithmetic.

<p>It is easy to compile Lua so that it uses another type
for numbers, such as longs or single-precision floats.
This is particularly useful for platforms
without hardware support for floating point.
See the distribution for detailed instructions.

<p>We can write numeric constants with an optional decimal part,
plus an optional decimal exponent.
Examples of valid numeric constants are:
<pre>
    4     0.4     4.57e-3     0.3e12     5e+20
</pre>
