<h2>16.5 &ndash; The Single-Method Approach</h2>

<p>A particular case of the previous approach for OO programming
occurs when an object has a single method.
In such cases, we do not need to create an interface table;
instead, we can return this single method as the object representation.
If this sounds a little weird,
it is worth remembering <a href="7.1.html#iter-closure">Section 7.1</a>,
where we saw how to construct iterator functions
that keep state as closures.
An iterator that keeps state is nothing more
than a single-method object.

<p>Another interesting case of single-method objects occurs when
this single-method is actually a dispatch method that
performs different tasks based on a distinguished argument.
A possible implementation for such object is as follows:
<pre>
    function newObject (value)
      return function (action, v)
        if action == "get" then return value
        elseif action == "set" then value = v
        else error("invalid action")
        end
      end
    end
</pre>
Its use is straightforward:
<pre>
    d = newObject(0)
    print(d("get"))    --> 0
    d("set", 10)
    print(d("get"))    --> 10
</pre>

<p>This unconventional implementation for objects is quite effective.
The syntax <code>d("set",10)</code>,
although peculiar,
is only two characters longer than
the more conventional <code>d:set(10)</code>.
Each object uses one single closure,
which is cheaper than one table.
There is no inheritance, but we have full privacy:
The only way to access an object state is through its sole method.

<p>Tcl/Tk uses a similar approach for its widgets.
The name of a widget in Tk denotes a function
(a <em>widget command</em>) that can perform all kinds of
operations over the widget.
