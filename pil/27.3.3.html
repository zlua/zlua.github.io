<h3>27.3.3 &ndash; Upvalues</h3>

<p>While the registry implements global values,
the <em>upvalue</em> mechanism implements an equivalent
of C static variables,
which are visible only inside a particular function.
Every time you create a new C function in Lua,
you can associate with it any number of upvalues;
each upvalue can hold a single Lua value.
Later, when the function is called,
it has free access to any of its upvalues,
using pseudo-indices.

<p>We call this association of a C function
with its upvalues a <em>closure</em>.
Remember that, in Lua code,
a closure is a function that uses local variables from an outer function.
A C closure is a C approximation to a Lua closure.
One interesting fact about closures is that you can create
different closures using the same function code,
but with different upvalues.

<p>To see a simple example,
let us create a <code>newCounter</code> function in C.
(We already defined this same function in Lua,
in <a href="6.1.html#closures">Section 6.1</a>.)
This function is a factory function:
It returns a new counter function each time it is called.
Although all counters share the same C code,
each one keeps its own independent counter.
The factory function is like this:
<pre>
    /* forward declaration */
    static int counter (lua_State *L);
    
    int newCounter (lua_State *L) {
      lua_pushnumber(L, 0);
      lua_pushcclosure(L, &amp;counter, 1);
      return 1;
    }
</pre>
The key function here is <code>lua_pushcclosure</code>,
which creates a new closure.
Its second argument is the base function (<code>counter</code>, in the example)
and the third is the number of upvalues (1, in the example).
Before creating a new closure,
we must push on the stack the initial values for its upvalues.
In our example, we push the number 0 as the initial value for the
single upvalue.
As expected,
<code>lua_pushcclosure</code> leaves the new closure on the stack,
so the closure is ready to be returned as the result of <code>newCounter</code>.

<p>Now, let us see the definition of <code>counter</code>:

<pre>
    static int counter (lua_State *L) {
      double val = lua_tonumber(L, lua_upvalueindex(1));
      lua_pushnumber(L, ++val);  /* new value */
      lua_pushvalue(L, -1);  /* duplicate it */
      lua_replace(L, lua_upvalueindex(1));  /* update upvalue */
      return 1;  /* return new value */
    }
</pre>
Here, the key function is <code>lua_upvalueindex</code>
(which is actually a macro),
which produces the pseudo-index of an upvalue.
Again, this pseudo-index is like any stack index,
except that it does not live in the stack.
The expression <code>lua_upvalueindex(1)</code> refers to the index of
the first upvalue of the function.
So, the <code>lua_tonumber</code> in function <code>counter</code>
retrieves the current value of the first (and only) upvalue as a number.
Then, function <code>counter</code> pushes the new value <code>++val</code>,
makes a copy of it,
and uses one of the copies to replace the upvalue with the new value.
Finally, it returns the other copy as its return value.

<p>Unlike Lua closures, C closures cannot share upvalues:
Each closure has its own independent set.
However, we can set the upvalues of different functions
to refer to a common table,
so that this table becomes a common place where those functions
can share data.
