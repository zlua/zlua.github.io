<h2><a name="API-stack">24.2 &ndash; The Stack</a></h2>

<p>We face two problems when trying to exchange values between Lua and C:
the mismatch between a dynamic and a static type system
and the mismatch between
automatic and manual memory management.

<p>In Lua, when we write <code>a[k] = v</code>,
both <code>k</code> and <code>v</code> can have several different types
(even <code>a</code> may have different types,
due to metatables).
If we want to offer this operation in C, however,
any <code>settable</code> function must have a fixed type.
We would need dozens of different functions for this single operation
(one function for each combination of types for the three arguments).

<p>We could solve this problem by declaring some kind of union type in C,
let us call it <code>lua_Value</code>,
that could represent all Lua values.
Then, we could declare <code>settable</code> as
<pre>
    void lua_settable (lua_Value a, lua_Value k, lua_Value v);
</pre>
This solution has two drawbacks.
First, it can be difficult to map
such a complex type to other languages;
Lua has been designed to
interface easily not only with C/C++,
but also with Java, Fortran, and the like.
Second, Lua does garbage collection:
If we keep a Lua value in a C variable,
the Lua engine has no way to know about this use;
it may (wrongly) assume that this value is garbage
and collect it.

<p>Therefore, the Lua API does not define
anything like a <code>lua_Value</code> type.
Instead, it uses an abstract stack to exchange values between Lua and C.
Each slot in this stack can hold any Lua value.
Whenever you want to ask for a value from Lua
(such as the value of a global variable),
you call Lua, which pushes the required value on the stack.
Whenever you want to pass a value to Lua,
you first push the value on the stack,
and then you call Lua (which will pop the value).
We still need a different function to push each C type on the stack
and a different function to get each value from the stack,
but we avoid the combinatorial explosion.
Moreover, because this stack is managed by Lua,
the garbage collector knows which values C is using.

<p>Nearly all functions in the API use the stack.
As we saw in our first example,
<code>luaL_loadbuffer</code> leaves its result on the stack
(either the compiled chunk or an error message);
<code>lua_pcall</code> gets the function to be called from the stack
and leaves any occasional error message there.

<p>Lua manipulates this stack in a strict LIFO discipline
(Last In, First Out; that is, always through the top).
When you call Lua, it only changes the top part of the stack.
Your C code has more freedom;
specifically, it can inspect any element inside the stack
and even insert and delete elements in any arbitrary position.
