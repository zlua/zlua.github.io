<h2>21.1 &ndash; The Simple I/O Model</h2>

<p>The simple model does all of its operations on two current files.
The library initializes the current input file as
the process's standard input (<code>stdin</code>)
and the current output file as
the process's standard output (<code>stdout</code>).
Therefore, when we execute something like <code>io.read()</code>,
we read a line from the standard input.

<p>We can change those current files with the <code>io.input</code>
and <code>io.output</code> functions.
A call like <code>io.input(filename)</code> opens the given file (in read mode)
and sets it as the current input file.
From this point on, all input will come from this file,
until another call to <code>io.input</code>;
<code>io.output</code> does a similar job for output.
In case of errors, both functions raise the error.
If you want to handle errors directly,
you must use <code>io.open</code>, from the complete model.

<p>As <code>write</code> is simpler than <code>read</code>,
we will look at it first.
The <code>io.write</code> function simply gets an arbitrary number
of string arguments
and writes them to the current output file.
Numbers are converted to strings following the usual conversion rules;
for full control over this conversion, you should use
the <code>format</code> function, from the <code>string</code> library:
<pre>
    > io.write("sin (3) = ", math.sin(3), "\n")
      --> sin (3) = 0.1411200080598672
    > io.write(string.format("sin (3) = %.4f\n", math.sin(3)))
      --> sin (3) = 0.1411
</pre>
Avoid code like <code>io.write(a..b..c)</code>;
the call <code>io.write(a,b,c)</code> accomplishes the same effect with
fewer resources, as it avoids the concatenations.

<p>As a rule, you should use <code>print</code>
for quick-and-dirty programs, or for debugging,
and <code>write</code> when you need full control over your output:
<pre>
    > print("hello", "Lua"); print("Hi")
      --> hello   Lua
      --> Hi
    
    > io.write("hello", "Lua"); io.write("Hi", "\n")
      --> helloLuaHi
</pre>
Unlike <code>print</code>, <code>write</code> adds no extra characters
to the output, such as tabs or newlines.
Moreover, <code>write</code> uses the current output file,
whereas <code>print</code> always uses the standard output.
Finally, <code>print</code> automatically applies <code>tostring</code>
to its arguments,
so it can also show tables, functions, and <B>nil</B>.

<p>The <code>read</code> function reads strings from the current input file.
Its arguments control what is read:
<table align="center" border=1>
<tr><td><code>"*all"</code></td><td>reads the whole file</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"*line"</code></td><td>reads the next line</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>"*number"</code></td><td>reads a number</td></tr>
<tr><td><em>num</em></td><td>reads a string with up to <em>num</em> characters</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The call <code>io.read("*all")</code> reads the whole current input file,
starting at its current position.
If we are at the end of file, or if the file is empty,
the call returns an empty string.

<p>Because Lua handles long strings efficiently,
a simple technique for writing filters in Lua is
to read the whole file into a string,
do the processing to the string (typically with <code>gsub</code>),
and then write the string to the output:
<pre>
    t = io.read("*all")         -- read the whole file
    t = string.gsub(t, ...)     -- do the job
    io.write(t)                 -- write the file
</pre>
As an example, the following code is a complete program to
code a file's content using the <em>quoted-printable</em> encoding
of MIME.
In this encoding, non-ASCII characters are coded as <code>=</code><em>XX</em>,
where <em>XX</em> is the numeric code of the character in hexadecimal.
To keep the consistency of the encoding, the `<code>=</code>&acute; character
must be encoded as well.
The pattern used in the <code>gsub</code> captures all characters
with codes from 128 to 255, plus the equal sign.
<pre>
    t = io.read("*all")
    t = string.gsub(t, "([\128-\255=])", function (c)
          return string.format("=%02X", string.byte(c))
        end)
    io.write(t)
</pre>
On a Pentium 333MHz, this program takes 0.2 seconds
to convert a file with 200K characters.

<p>The call <code>io.read("*line")</code> returns the
next line from the current input file, without the newline character.
When we reach the end of file, the call returns <B>nil</B>
(as there is no next line to return).
This pattern is the default for <code>read</code>,
so <code>io.read()</code> has the same effect as <code>io.read("*line")</code>.
Usually, we use this pattern only when our algorithm naturally
handles the file line by line;
otherwise, we favor reading the whole file at once, with <code>*all</code>,
or in blocks, as we will see later.
As a simple example of the use of this pattern,
the following program copies its current input to the current output,
numbering each line:
<pre>
    local count = 1
    while true do
      local line = io.read()
      if line == nil then break end
      io.write(string.format("%6d  ", count), line, "\n")
      count = count + 1
    end
</pre>
However, to iterate on a whole file line by line,
we do better to use the <code>io.lines</code> iterator.
For instance,
we can write a complete program to sort the lines of a file as follows:
<pre>
    local lines = {}
    -- read the lines in table 'lines'
    for line in io.lines() do
      table.insert(lines, line)
    end
    -- sort
    table.sort(lines)
    -- write all the lines
    for i, l in ipairs(lines) do io.write(l, "\n") end
</pre>
This program sorts a file with 4.5 MB (32K lines)
in 1.8 seconds (on a Pentium 333MHz),
against 0.6 seconds spent by the system <code>sort</code> program,
which is written in C and highly optimized.

<p>The call <code>io.read("*number")</code>
reads a number from the current input file.
This is the only case where <code>read</code> returns a number,
instead of a string.
When you need to read many numbers from a file,
the absence of the intermediate strings can make a significant
performance improvement.
The <code>*number</code> option skips any spaces before the number
and accepts number formats like <code>-3</code>, <code>+5.2</code>,
<code>1000</code>, and <code>-3.4e-23</code>.
If it cannot find a number at the current file position
(because of bad format or end of file),
it returns <B>nil</B>.

<p>You can call <code>read</code> with multiple options;
for each argument, the function will return the respective result.
Suppose you have a file with three numbers per line:

<pre>
    6.0       -3.23     15e12
    4.3       234       1000001
    ...
</pre>
Now you want to print the maximum of each line.
You can read all three numbers in a single call to <code>read</code>:
<pre>
    while true do
      local n1, n2, n3 = io.read("*number", "*number",
                                 "*number")
      if not n1 then break end
      print(math.max(n1, n2, n3))
    end
</pre>
In any case,
you should always consider the alternative of reading the whole
file with option <code>"*all"</code> from <code>io.read</code>
and then using <code>gfind</code> to break it up:
<pre>
    local pat = "(%S+)%s+(%S+)%s+(%S+)%s+"
    for n1, n2, n3 in string.gfind(io.read("*all"), pat) do
      print(math.max(n1, n2, n3))
    end
</pre>

<p>Besides the basic read patterns,
you can call <code>read</code> with a number <em>n</em> as argument:
In this case, <code>read</code> tries to read <em>n</em> characters
from the input file.
If it cannot read any character (end of file),
<code>read</code> returns <B>nil</B>;
otherwise, it returns a string with at most <em>n</em> characters.
As an example of this read pattern,
the following program is an efficient way (in Lua, of course)
to copy a file from <code>stdin</code> to <code>stdout</code>:
<pre>
    local size = 2^13      -- good buffer size (8K)
    while true do
      local block = io.read(size)
      if not block then break end
      io.write(block)
    end
</pre>

<p>As a special case, <code>io.read(0)</code> works as a test for end of file:
It returns an empty string if there is more to be read
or <B>nil</B> otherwise.
