scripts.  After all of that preparation, I abandoned Python for Lua.
Lua is lighter [and] is easier to embed.

want easy embedding, Lua's the right tool.&rdquo;

&ldquo;My advice... save yourself a lot of pain and use Lua.  Lua is a small,
powerful, efficient scripting language.  It was written specifically as
an extension language and it's very good.  I haven't seen any language
(including Python) which is a better choice for embedding.
Lua is a truly wonderful language  &ndash;clean, small, efficient, and free
for commercial use.  It's very solid code (current version 3.1), used
in many industrial applications.  It's also well supported.
One of the things I like best about it is that I can't think of any way
to improve it.  If I had decided to write a scripting language for
myself, I doubt mine would be as good.  For the record, the original Lua
code base was generated with flex/bison or lex/yacc, and evolved from
there.  So, if you're planning on going the flex/bison route, save
yourself 3 years of refinement and use Lua.&rdquo;
