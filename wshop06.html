<P>

A Lua workshop will be held at
the R&amp;D site of Oc&eacute; Technologies b.v., Venlo, The Netherlands
on September 4-5, 2006.
<P>

The main goal of the workshop is to allow the Lua
<A HREF="community.html">community</A>
(or at least part of it)
to get together and meet in person and talk about
the Lua language, its uses, and its implementation.
<P>

Another goal is to help spread the word about Lua to the industry and academia,
taking advantage of the location of the workshop.
<P>

The workshop is open to everyone interested in Lua.
There is no registration fee but
participants are required to
<A HREF="#registration">register</A>.

<!-- <EM>We're getting very close to the limit. -->
<!-- EM>Please <A HREF="#registration">register now</A>.</EM -->

<H2><A NAME="programme">Programme</A></H2>

We shall have
a plenary talk by Roberto Ierusalimschy (Lua's chief architect),
two roundtables on Lua (subjects to be determined)
and several contributed talks.
There will also be plenty of time for getting together and chatting about Lua.
A tentative programme is below.

<H2><A NAME="abstracts">Abstracts</A></H2>

Here are the abstracts and slides of the talks, in alphabetical order of the
speakers.

<P>
<A NAME="Belmonte"><B>Exception Patterns in Lua</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Belmonte.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>John Belmonte</EM>

<P> Users of the Lua programming language often aren't aware that it includes
elements to support custom exceptions and common try/except constructs. This
talk will present simple yet powerful examples of each, covering topics not
addressed in <I>Programming in Lua</I> such as selective catching and
re-raising of exceptions. It will also provide general pointers on how
exceptions are best employed. Finally, some recommendations for improved
exception support in Lua will be offered.

<P>
<A NAME="Burke"><B>Lua and the Palm OS</B></A>
<BR>
<EM>Matthew Burke, St. Mary's College of Maryland</EM>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="http://bluedino.net/talks/lua06/">slides</A>

<P>
<A NAME="Carregal"><B>Kepler/LuaForge next steps</B></A>
<BR>
<EM>Andr&eacute; Carregal, F&aacute;brica Digital</EM>

<P> The Kepler team is currently focusing on new features that will make things
a lot easier for module and application developers. We will be presenting two
of them on the workshop:

<UL>
<LI> Rocks is a system that allows the versioning of Lua packages, their
dependencies and guarantees that every package installed by Rocks will continue
to work, even if its dependencies are updated.
<LI> Orbit is an MVC framework for Kepler that allows easier control of web
applications flow and presentation.
</UL>

We will also present the plans for the new LuaForge site and its
interaction with Rocks.

<P>
<A NAME="Couwenberg"><B>Simulation of complex systems</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Couwenberg.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Wim Couwenberg, Oc&eacute; Technologies b.v.</EM>

<P> In a system that comprises several processor architectures, different
OS'es, partly real-time and all strung together with relatively slow
connections it is not always easy to predict system behaviour.  Small changes
in parameters can have big  effects.

<P> To easily play through scenarios a tiny simulation tool was developed in
Lua. A miniature &ldquo;complex environment&rdquo; was created with coroutines
taking the role of processes, coordinated by an event triggered scheduler.
Based on this event framework system resources like processor, connections,
semaphores, memory etc. were implemented.  Since (almost) no <EM>actual</EM>
time passes between events, this simulated environment quickly produces timing
output to visualize all sorts of scenarios.

<P>
<A NAME="FleckGraffe"><B>Building Smalltalk with Lua (A Smalltalk to Lua Translator)</B></A>
<SPAN CLASS="cancelled">cancelled</SPAN>
<BR>
<EM>Markus Fleck-Graffe</EM>

<P> Traditionally, Smalltalk implementations have been rather heavyweight
and not easily embeddable, usually coming with their own virtual machine
and tightly integrated graphical user interface. In addition, most Smalltalk
implementations have licensing issues that restrict embedding.

<P> This talk will give a minimal introduction to the Smalltalk language,
and present some initial strategies for implementing an embeddable
Smalltalk system by dynamic translation to Lua.

<P>
<A NAME="Hagen"><B>LuaTeX</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Hagen.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Hans Hagen, Pragma ADE</EM>

<P> The pdfTeX development team is currently working on a major upgrade. The
code base is cleaned up, the 8 memory constraints are widened to 24/32 bits,
and internally utf-8 will be used. This opens the road to native support for
open type fonts and more advanced support for the more demanding languages.

<P> It was already decided to provide Lua as embedded scripting language on top
of the TeX macro language. As it looks now, we will also use Lua as a glue
language between new subsystems and the (also to be extended) TeX kernel.
Moreover, we will provide callbacks to TeX's internals and thereby make it
possible to do complex contextual analysis and manipulations.

<P> In this presentation I will give an overview of where we stand now and where
we're heading.

<P>
<A NAME="Hirschi"><B>Developing desktop solutions with Lua</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="http://dev.reflexis.nl/lua/">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Ashwin Hirschi, Reflexis</EM>

<P> Even though Lua is perhaps best known as a scripting language to extend and
configure existing systems, it is more than capable enough to be the main
ingredient if you're developing standalone applications.

<P> In order to streamline development of its products, Reflexis created a
Windows runtime that acts as a compact (approx. 200K) and flexible Lua host
application. This system provides a platform that's easy to develop for, and is
even easier to deploy.

<P> In this talk we'll discuss some of the runtime's subsystems, the open-ended
GUI facilities, the multi-threaded enviroments, the integrated profiler,
auto-configuration & easy deployment, lessons learned, possible ways into the
future, and - as time allows - more.

<P>
<A NAME="Hougaard"><B>Crazy Ivan Robot</B></A>
<BR>
<EM>Erik Hougaard, E Foqus Denmark A/S</EM>
<P> For the last seven years, a competitor in the Danish robotic race
&ldquo;DTU RoboCup&rdquo; has been a Lua driven robot called &lsquo;Crazy
Ivan&rsquo;. Crazy Ivan has won more than any other robot in the competition.
The Crazy Ivan robot is designed to drive through a predefined race track and
solve different tasks such as climbing stairs, passing a guillotine and much
more. Lua is used as the programming language for the robot's
&ldquo;brain&rdquo; and all decisions are taken in Lua. Indeed some of the low
level processing for the robot is handled within Lua while a very small C stub
is used to interface with the hardware. On the day, Crazy Ivan will be running
live on the floor while its &ldquo;Master&rdquo; Erik Hougaard will try to
control the action. Anything can &mdash;and will&mdash; happen!

<P>
<A NAME="Ierusalimschy"><B>The Evolution of Lua</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Ierusalimschy.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Roberto Ierusalimschy, PUC-Rio</EM>

<P> In this presentation, we report on the birth and evolution of Lua. We
discuss how Lua moved from its simple origins as a configuration language to a
powerful (but still simple) language that now supports extensible semantics,
anonymous functions, full lexical closures, proper tail calls, and coroutines.

<P>
<A NAME="Kauppi"><B>Websites with Lua - Lumikki web page creation tools</B></A>
<BR>
<EM>Asko Kauppi, Nomovok</EM>

<P>
Lumikki uses Lua as an embeddable macro language  within HTML coding, allowing
build-time &ldquo;templating&rdquo; of web pages. Integration with tools s.a.
ImageMagick allow for strong build-time image processing capabilities, too.
Lumikki can be used either with standard HTML, or together with any web
building techniques (CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ajax, ...). The generated contents
has no trace of Lua; and needs no extra server software to be viewed. As is the
spirit of Lua, also Lumikki can easily be extended with page- or site-specific
custom macros.

<P>
I am myself using Lumikki on a &euro;95 NSLU2 personal web host, and running
Lua therein. The plans are to further merge Lumikki with svn, so multiple
persons can jointly develop a website, using svn for collision handling. An svn
commit would automatically run Lumikki to regenerate the actually viewable
contents.  (svn integration is not yet implemented, but will be!)

<P>
<A NAME="Rodriguez"><B>Distributed programming in Lua</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Rodriguez.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Noemi Rodriguez, PUC-Rio</EM>

<P> In this talk we discuss how constructs present in Lua allow us to build
high level distributed programming abstractions and combine them seamlessly. We
also discuss our use of coroutines to support a concurrency model which avoids
race conditions and the need for synchronization.

<P>
<A NAME="Schardt"><B>MeLua - Lua for representing musical scores</B></A>
<BR>
<EM>Christof Schardt</EM>

<P> While working on my musical notation editor &ldquo;PriMus&rdquo; I
developed a language called &ldquo;Emil&rdquo; (easy music input language). It
is TeX-influenced and combines musical score capabilities with text typesetting
and basic programming mechanisms. MeLua now is an attempt to marry Lua and
Emil.

<P>
<A NAME="Silverstone"><B>The Aranha Web App Platform</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Silverstone.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Daniel Silverstone, Simtec Electronics</EM>

<P>
<A NAME="Silverstone2"><B>Token filters</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Silverstone2.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Daniel Silverstone, Simtec Electronics</EM>

<P>
<A NAME="Taapken"><B>Open Platform for Personal Robotics</B></A>
<BR>
<EM>Dennis Taapken, Philips Research</EM>
<P> Philips Research has developed the iCat Research Platform, which makes it
easy for researchers and universities all over the world to do research on
robotics. One of the major parts of this platform is the software package
called Open Platform for Personal Robotics&trade;, OPPR. This software package
provides solutions in four areas: architecture, connectivity, believability and
intelligence. The last two areas are what makes a robot come to life.  Within
these areas Lua has taken a prominent position as an easy to use yet flexible
and extensible scripting engine. Lua can be used in OPPR to describe robot
behaviours, prototype algorithms, directly control the robots output (e.g.
servos, lights), specify a configuration script and more. In this presentation
we will present the following topics: what is OPPR, why did we choose lua, how
did we integrate lua, where are we going with lua and our current findings on
the lua environment.

<P>
<A NAME="Thomas"><B>Nancy</B></A>
<A CLASS="slides" HREF="wshop06/Thomas.pdf">slides</A>
<BR>
<EM>Reuben Thomas</EM>

<P> The lazy person's web site maker.  <A HREF="http://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/Nancy/">Nancy</A> is a simple web site builder. It
has just one construct: context-dependent file inclusion. With this single
feature you can build pretty much any web site whose logical structure mirrors
its URL layout, and which does not rely on dynamically computed content, out of
fragments (of HTML, CSS, text, and whatever else you like) plus other files
(images, audio &amp;c.).
