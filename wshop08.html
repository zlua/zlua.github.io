<p>A Lua workshop will be held at
<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/">The George Washington University</a>
in Washington, D.C on July 14-15, 2008.</p>

<p>Like previous workshops in
<a href="wshop05.html">2005</a>
and
<a href="wshop06.html">2006</a>,
the main goal of the workshop is to allow the
Lua <a href="http://www.lua.org/community.html">community</a> (or at
least part of it) to get together and meet in person and talk about
the Lua language, its uses, and its implementation.  Another goal is
to help spread the word about Lua to industry and academia, taking
advantage of the location of the workshop.
</p>

<p>The workshop is open to everyone interested in Lua. There is no
registration fee but participants are required to
<a href="#registration">register</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="venue">Venue</a></h2>

<p>The workshop will be held on GW's  <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/mvmap.jpg">Mount Vernon campus</a>.  In particular, Monday's session will be held in the Hand Chapel (Pictures: <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/Hand1.jpg">1</a>, <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/Hand2.jpg">2</a>, <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/Hand3.jpg">3</a>, <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/Hand4.jpg">4</a>; and <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/mvmap.jpg">campus map</a>).  Tuesday's session will be held in Post Hall (Picture: <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/Post1.jpg">1</a>; and <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/mvmap.jpg">campus map</a>).  The A/V facilities include a PC connected to a large presentation screen, plugs if you want to project your laptop, a smart board (Hand Chapel only), a white board, CD/DVD, and a microphone/speakers.  If you have any particular requests, please <a href="mailto:lua.workshop@gmail.com">email</a> the organizers. <em><strong>Please Note:</strong> if you have difficulty navigating stairs, <a href="mailto:mmburke@gwu.edu">email</a> Matthew Burke.</em></p>

<h3><a name="shuttle">Shuttle to Mount Vernon Campus</a></h3>

<p>There is a free shuttle (10 minute ride) from GW's downtown campus.  The shuttle leaves every 15 minutes from 23rd and H Streets (except from 6am-10am when it leaves from 21st and H Streets).  See <a href="http://gwired.gwu.edu/mvcl/Express/schedule/#summer3">here</a> for shuttle details.</p>

<h3><a name="parking">Parking at the Mount Vernon Campus</a></h3>

<p>All parking must occur within the campus boundaries in either the Parking Garage inside the Whitehaven Parkway entrance or the Parking Lot inside the W street entrance.  The Parking Lot inside the W street entrance has meters (<span class="note">so probably not a good choice for parking</span>) that are monitored between 7:00am-7:00pm.  The Parking Garage inside the Whitehaven Parkway entrance is attended between 7:00am-10:00pm (<span class="note">10 USD for the entire day</span>).  See the <a href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/mvmap.jpg">campus map</a>.</p> 

<p>Parking on the streets in the area around the campus will result in <strong>tickets and/or towing!</strong></p>


<h2><a name="accommodation">Accommodation</a></h2>

<p>Single and double-occupancy dormitory rooms are available on GW's Mount Vernon campus (the site of the workshop).  The cost (including tax) for a double-occupancy room is $39.80 per person per night if you are staying one or two nights and $36.35 per person per night if you stay more than two nights.  For single occupancy, the costs are $70.70/$64.98 per night.</p> 

<p>Dormitory rooms are available on a first-come, first-served basis so we need to get reservations in soon.  If you are interested in a room, please fill in the form below and <a href="mailto:lua.workshop@gmail.com?subject=dorm_reservations">email</a> it to the organizers <strong>by Sunday, 17 February 2008</strong>.</p>

<p>There are several hotels in downtown Washington that offer special rates for those attending functions at GWU.  These hotels are all within a 10-15 minute walk of the Mount Vernon shuttle bus stops on the Foggy Bottom campus.  If you choose to stay at one of these hotels, plan on spending 30-40 minutes to get from your hotel to the workshop (<em>walk to the shuttle stop, wait for shuttle, 10-15 minute shuttle ride</em>).</p>

<p>
 The following map shows the locations of the shuttle bus stops, the Foggy Bottom campus, the hotels with special rates, and the Mount Vernon campus (where the workshop will be held).  The blue pinpoint is the the Georgetown University Conference Hotel.  It doesn't have a GWU rate, and there's no easy way to get from there to the Mount Vernon campus other than by foot or taxi (it's about 1.5 miles), but it is the closest hotel to the workshop.  Contact information for the hotels can be found <a href="http://gwired.gwu.edu/adm/visit/hotels">here</a>, or by clicking on the map.</p>

<p><a name="barros"><strong>Eliminating Cycles in Weak Tables</strong></a><br/>
<em>Alexandra Barros (PUC-Rio)</em></p>

<p>Weak references constitute an elegant mechanism for an
application to interact with its garbage collector. In most of its
typical uses, weak references are used through weak tables (e.g.,
Java's WeakHashMap). However, most implementations of weak tables have
a severe limitation: Cyclic references between keys and values in weak
tables prevent the elements inside the cycle from being collected,
even if they are no longer reachable from outside. This ends up
bringing difficulties to the use of weak tables in some kinds of
applications.</p>

<p>In this work, we present a mechanism for overcoming this problem of
cycles in weak tables. The proposed mechanism is an adaptation of the
concept of ephemerons to tables. We modified the garbage collector of
the Lua virtual machine in order to offer support to this mechanism.
With this adapted garbage collector we could verify the efficiency and
effectiveness of the implementation in solving the problem of cycles
on weak tables in Lua.</p>

<p><a name="campbell"><strong>Developing a Complex Native Windows Application in Lua</strong></a> <a class="slides" href="http://serotek.com/mattc/wshop08-talk/">slides</a><br/>
<em>Matt Campbell (Serotek)</em></p>

<p>Lua is one of the best dynamic languages for developing desktop applications that must download and start up quickly, especially on Windows.  However, there are some challenges associated with using Lua as the primary language for an application that integrates closely with Windows.  These challenges will be discussed in the context of Serotek's System Access product, which provides access to Windows and the Web for blind and low-vision users.  The talk will also include a comparison of Lua and Python from the perspective of an experienced Python user.</p>

<p><a name="carvalho"><strong>Numlua: a Numerical Package for Lua</strong></a> <a class="slides" href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/carvalho-numlua.pdf">slides</a><br/>
<em>Luis Carvalho (Brown University)</em></p>

<p>Numlua is a numerical package for Lua that includes support for complex
numbers, multidimensional matrices, random number generation, and special
functions. In the this talk we present Numlua, describe some of its
implementation details as a minimal wrapper around well-known, stable, and
efficient numerical packages, and finally discuss future work and directions
for Numlua.</p>

<p><a name="ferwerda"><strong>Business Applications with Lua</strong></a> <a class="slides" href="http://bluedino.net/luapix/Jelle.ppt">slides</a><br/>
<em>Jelle Ferwerda (LogicNets)</em></p>

<p>LogicNets is an application development environment that business experts
can use to  create their own cutting edge software applications. By building
process-flow-like combinations of individual steps users define logical
methods for accomplishing specific tasks. These process flows can be used as
complete applications, or can be used as building blocks to combine in
endless arrangements. Completed applications can be published as web or
stand alone applications.</p>

<p>Most customers are using LogicNets as a hosted service to develop and
maintain their own business applications resulting in thousands of end users
interacting with these applications on a daily basis. During this
presentation we will demonstrate how Lua is used at the heart of the
LogicNets system providing us with both the flexibility and the performance
required. We will show examples of how product engineers in Ingersoll Rand
and safety experts in FOX Networks rather than software developers are using
the LogicNets system to develop high end business applications. We will
discuss how organizations, such as NASA have joined LogicNets as a partner
to develop the system into new areas. For more information, please visit
www.logicnets.com</p>

<p><a name="hougaard"><strong>Lua and .NET</strong></a><br/><em>Erik Hougaard</em></p>

<p><a name="ierusalimschy"><strong>LPEG&mdash;a New Approach to Pattern Matching in Lua</strong></a> <a class="slides" href="  http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/lpeg/slides-lpeg-workshop2008.pdf">slides</a><br/>
<em>Roberto Ierusalimschy (PUC-Rio, Lua team)</em></p>

<p>Currently, most pattern matching tools are an ad-hoc collection of
features loosely inspired in regular expressions.  LPEG is a new library for pattern matching for Lua, with a new approach.
LPEG is grounded in Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs), a formalism
for parsing languages. LPEG unifies the easy of use of conventional
pattern-matching tools with the full expressive power of PEGs, and
avoids the myriad of ad-hoc constructions present in current tools.
An implementation based on a new Parsing Machine ensures a performance
on par with similar tools.</p>

<p><a name="labenski"><strong>wxLua Internals</strong></a><br/><em>John Labenski</em></p>

<p>wxLua is a set of bindings to the cross-platform wxWidgets C++ GUI
library for the Lua programming language. A custom binding generator
is used to generate C structs and functions to store and implement the
interface between the two languages. C++ classes are wrapped by Lua
userdata whose metatables provide hooks for the C++ member function
calls. Some pros, cons, and pitfalls of this method will be presented
as well as other challenges faced in binding a large GUI library with
its own event loop.</p>

<p><a name="mascarenhas"><strong>LuaRocks and the Kepler "reboot"</strong></a><br/>
<em>Fabio Mascarenhas (LabLua, PUC-Rio)</em></p>

<p>The Kepler framework is a collection of over ten interdependent Lua
libraries that work together to let Kepler users quickly develop and
deploy web applications using the Lua language. Distributing Kepler
has always been a big problem for the Kepler team, despite Lua 5.1's
module systems and efforts to create standard binaries for Windows.
Kepler used to have a monolithic Makefile-based installer that bundled
and installed all required libraries; this installer did the job, but
was a hassle to maintain, and creating a Windows distribution was
still a manual process. Last year the Kepler team introduced LuaRocks,
which is a platform-agnostic build and installation system, as well as
a way to manage versioning of packages both during installation and at
runtime. LuaRocks has its own build system, but its modular
architecture lets it use other build systems as well. LuaRocks let the
Kepler team completely redo Kepler's installer, which is now more
maintanable and cross-platform.</p>

<p>The changes we did to Kepler since the last Lua workshop do not stop
at the installer; we also have a new underlying architecture for
talking to web servers called WSAPI, which is independent of Kepler
itself (the Sputnik wiki uses it too), as well as a new application
framework for "MVC" web development called Orbit. Subsidiary Kepler
modules also have seen big improvements, and all of them have in
common the fact that they can be easily installed with LuaRocks
independently of Kepler. In this talk we'll give an overview of the
recently released version 1.1 of Kepler , as well the latest pre-1.0
version of LuaRocks.</p>

<em>Terry Moore (MCCI)</em></p>

<p>Bright is a production cross-platform scripting language derived from Lua 4.0.  Bright's syntax is C-like, 
easing use by MCCI developers who work daily in C.  MCCI added an "undefined" value, extended tables 
to support explicit NULL entries, changed the index origin to zero, and changed the .exe wrappers to work 
better with shell-based scripting.  The resulting language combines the conceptual elegance of Lua with 
a language more compatible with C infrastructure.    We use Bright for portable cross-platform 
command-line scripting on Unix (NetBSD, Mac OS X, Linux) and Windows, and embed it in various tools 
(e.g., make, system test tools). </p>

<em>Norman Ramsey<sup>*</sup> (Tufts University) and Fidelis Assis (Embratel)</em></p>

<p>It's difficult to scale a part-time Lua project beyond 10,000 lines,
because a Lua *package* is not a *module*: to understand it, one has
to consult the source code of other packages.  At bottom, the problem
is that Lua has no standard way to express, let alone check, an API.
This talk describes work in progress designing and building a spam
filtering and mail handling system in Lua.  Although members of the
audience will learn enough to know if they want to try the software,
we emphasize lessons learned from our mistakes and successes: avoid
streams and objects; use the profiler; and most importantly, do
something about that pesky API problem!</p>

<em>John Rodriguez (VeriSign)</em></p>

<p>VeriSign is developing a high performance, always available database.
This requires that the architecture must be aggressively simplified.
Even the SQL language which is traditionally used for database queries
was rejected as too complex and Lua was chosen instead. This talk will
cover why Lua was selected as a better fit for an application that never
shuts down.</p>

<em>Chip Salzenberg (Cloudmark)</em></p>

<p>When Lua is integrated into an application that processes a data
stream, interning the ephemeral data stream as Lua strings imposes
expenses and brings little value.  Chip will describe a userdata-based
implementation of external strings and how they worked out in practice.</p>

<em>Michal Sieluzycki (Earth Computer Technology)</em></p>

<p>EarthLCD is developing a line of intelligent touchscreen LCD
modules with embedded Lua interpreters. In addition to the color
touchscreen LCD display, these modules have an SD card socket and a
multitude of interfaces (RS232, Hi-Speed USB, I2C, SPI, Ethernet and
discrete I/O). The LCD display, SD card and interfaces are supported
by an embedded Lua custom library, and are compatible with the
standard Lua libraries as well.  By utilizing Lua, an LCD can be
rapidly integrated into an embedded system, or medical device,
reducing product development cost and time to market.</p>

<em>Wesley Smith<sup>*</sup> and Graham Wakefield (Media Arts and Technology, UC Santa Barbara)</em></p>

<p>Computational audiovisual composition is the practice of composing
through a tight integration of time, space, sound and computation
where the composition is represented in an evaluable form (in this
case a script). In the development of this practice, we have developed
a real-time interactive audiovisual composition environment called
LuaAV.  Our presentation will show the conceptual development of LuaAV
and how it evolved vis-a-vis the Lua language with an overview of the
environment's structure and a walkthrough of the basic workflow with
live demonstrations and video documentation.</p>

<em>Yuri Takhteyev (UC Berkeley Shcool of Information / Kepler)</em> </p>

<p>Sputnik is a wiki/CMS/framework written in Lua using Kepler 1.1 and
LuaRocks for package management.  Sputnik is built on top of "Saci" -
a document-oriented hierarchical storage system with swappable modules
for actual Storage and using Lua as its data storage format.  I will
show a demo of Sputnik, talk about the way Sputnik and Saci take
advantage of Lua and available Lua modules, then show how Sputnik can
be extended into non-wiki applications, using a ticket-tracker as an
example.</p>

<p><a name="tarnow"><strong>Lua at Sim Ops Studios</strong></a><br/>
<em>Aaron Tarnow (Sim Ops Studios)</em></p>

<p>This talk will cover a brief description of the platform being developed by Sim Ops Studios, 
 what it is we were looking for in a scripting language, why we ended up choosing
Lua, and what we're doing with it today.</p>

<em>Richard Vuduc (Georgia Tech)</em></p>

<p>OSKI is a library that implements sparse linear algebra
operations whose performance is automatically tuned at run-time for a
user's input (matrix) and machine. I describe the motivation for OSKI
and outline its architecture, and furthermore explain the important
role that Lua plays in allowing the user to see and control the tuning
process.</p>

<em>Jim Whitehead II (University of Oxford)</em></p>

<p>Since World of Warcraft was released on November 23, 2004, it has
quickly grown to be one of the most popular video games ever created.
Currently boasting more than ten million subscribers, it's hard to
find someone who hasn't heard of the game.  World of Warcraft
leverages the power of Lua and XML to provide a rich and extensible
user interface by allowing anyone to create custom interface addons
which can both provide more information to the user and extend
interaction with the game.  This talk is an introduction to the way
Lua is used to create a secure interface to a commercial application.
In addition, we present a large body of Lua code that has been written
for custom addons but can easily be leveraged by the Lua community
at-large.</p>
