Lua is an extension programming language designed to support
general procedural programming features with data description
facilities.
It is supposed to be used as a configuration language for any
program that needs one.
Its main extensions are related to object-oriented facilities,
and fallbacks,
but it has some other minor contributions.
Lua has been designed and implemented by
W. Celes F., L. H. de Figueiredo and R. Ierusalimschy.
<P>
Lua is implemented as a library, written in C.
Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a ``main'' program:
it only works <I>embedded</I> in a host client,
called the <I>embedding</I> program.
This host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of
code in Lua, can write and read Lua variables,
and can register C functions to be called by Lua code.
Through the use of C functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with
rather different domains,
thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.
<P>
Lua is free distribution software,
and provided as usual with no guarantees.
The implementation described in this manual is available
