<P>
All statements in Lua are executed in a <I>global environment</I>.
This environment, which keeps all global variables and functions,
is initialized at the beginning of the embedding program and
persists until its end.
<P>
The global environment can be manipulated by Lua code or
by the embedding program,
which can read and write global variables
using functions in the library that implements Lua.
<P>
Global variables do not need declaration.
Any variable is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared local
(see local declarations, Section <A HREF=subsection3_4_4.html#localvar>4.4.5</A>).
Before the first assignment, the value of a global variable is <B>nil</B>.
<P>
The unit of execution of Lua is called a <I>module</I>.
The syntax for modules is:<A HREF=manual.foot.html#427>*</A>
<PRE>
   <I>module</I> ::= {<I> statement </I>|<I> function </I>}<BR></PRE>A module may contain statements and function definitions,
and may be in a file or in a string inside the host program.
When a module is executed, first all its functions and statements are compiled,
and the functions added to the global environment;
then the statements are executed in sequential order.
All modifications a module effects on the global environment persist
after its end.
Those include modifications to global variables and definitions
of new functions<A HREF=manual.foot.html#372>*</A>.
