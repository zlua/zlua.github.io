<P>
Functions in Lua can return many values.
Because there are no type declarations,
the system does not know how many values a function will return,
or how many parameters it needs.
Therefore, sometimes, a list of values must be <I> adjusted</I>, at run time,
to a given length.
If there are more values than are needed, the last values are thrown away.
If there are more needs than values, the list is extended with as
many  <B> nil</B> 's as needed.
Adjustment occurs in multiple assignment and function calls.
