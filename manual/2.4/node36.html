<H2><A NAME=S870>8.7 Programming with Classes</A></H2>
<P>
There are many different ways to do object-oriented programming in Lua.
This section presents one possible way to
implement classes,
using the inheritance mechanism presented above.
<I> Please notice: the following examples only work
with the index fallback redefined according to
Section <A HREF="node35.html#exfallback">8.6</A></I>.
<P>
As one could expect, a good way to represent a class is
as a table.
This table will contain all instance methods of the class,
plus eventual default values for instance variables.
An instance of a class has its <TT><B>parent</B></TT>
 field pointing to
the class,
and so it ``inherits'' all methods.
<P>
For instance, a class <TT><B>Point</B></TT>
 can be described as in
Figure <A HREF="#Point">2</A>.
Function <TT><B>create</B></TT>
 helps the creation of new points,
adding the parent field.
Function <TT><B>move</B></TT>
 is an example of an instance method.
<B><PRE>Point = {x = 0, y = 0}

function Point:create (o)
  o.parent = self
  return o
end

function Point:move (p)
  self.x = self.x + p.x
  self.y = self.y + p.y
end

...

--
-- creating points
--
p1 = Point:create{x = 10, y = 20}
p2 = Point:create{x = 10}  -- y will be inherited until it is set

--
-- example of a method invocation
--
p1:move(p2)
</PRE></B>
Finally, a subclass can be created as a new table,
with the <TT><B>parent</B></TT>
 field pointing to its superclass.
It is interesting to notice how the use of <TT><B>self</B></TT>
 in
method <TT><B>create</B></TT>
 allows this method to work properly even
when inherited by a subclass.
As usual, a subclass may overwrite any inherited method with
its own version.
